-- MIR-21-c: ADR-064 decision 3's self lock reaches `membership`, and the sign-up trigger stops naming
-- the team column.
--
-- Implements ADR-079 decision 1, within ADR-078 decision 6 (.ai/board/tickets/MIR-21-c/01-plan.md
-- § 4.1):
--
--   1. the security-invoker trigger function `membership_refuse_own_rows()` and a before-row trigger
--      on `public.membership` that refuses a write to the caller's own rows
--   2. `admit_allow_listed_member()` re-created without the team column in its insert
--
-- Today the lock holds only because every writer assigns `member.team_id` before it writes
-- `membership`, and `member_enforce_role_and_removal` refuses that change on the caller's own row.
-- MIR-21-d stops the assignment; from then on the refusal a self-move meets is the one below, with
-- the same message and errcode. During this slice both fire on a self-move, and the column clause
-- answers first.
--
-- No table, column, constraint, policy or table grant changes.
--
-- **IDEMPOTENT** (ADR-024): `create or replace` for each function, `drop trigger if exists` before
-- the trigger.
--
-- Applying this file to a remote database is human (RULE-09).

-- Re-created from its LATEST definition, `20260913090000_solo_avatar_images.sql` lines 46-81, with
-- one change: the insert no longer names the team column, so the column takes its default, which is
-- null, and the row inserted is the same row as before. The comment that described that column is
-- reworded to match. Every other line — the guards, the hard-coded role, the exception handler — is
-- copied unchanged, and the trigger that points at this function is not touched.
