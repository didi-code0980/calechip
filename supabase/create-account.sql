-- SOLO, 2026-09-10 — create ONE account with any email address at all. Applied by a human
-- (RULE-09), never by an agent, and never from application code.
--
-- ============================================================================================
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
-- ============================================================================================
--
-- Hosted Supabase refuses `signUp` for an address it judges undeliverable and answers
-- `email_address_invalid` — `test1@calechip.com` was refused because `calechip.com` does not exist
-- in DNS at all (NXDOMAIN: no A record, no MX). **There is no project setting that turns that check
-- off**, so no amount of configuration makes the shipped sign-up form accept a made-up domain.
--
-- What this file does instead is what `supabase/seed.sql` already does: insert the row into
-- `auth.users` DIRECTLY. GoTrue never sees the request, so nothing validates the address — the seed
-- creates `quan@example.com` and `thanh@example.com` this way, and `example.com` is an address the
-- hosted sign-up would reject for the same reason.
--
-- **THE ACCOUNT IS OTHERWISE COMPLETELY ORDINARY.** `email_confirmed_at` is set, so
-- `admit_allow_listed_member` fires exactly as it does for a real sign-up
-- (`20260910100000_solo_member_approval.sql`) and creates the `public.member` row with a null
-- `team_id` and `status = 'pending'` — the person is then approved by an admin through the
-- application, like anybody else. Set `calechip.new_approved` to `yes` to skip that and put them
-- straight onto the one team.
--
-- ============================================================================================
-- WHAT IT IS NOT
-- ============================================================================================
--
-- **NOT A MIGRATION, and it must never become one.** `supabase/migrations/` is applied to every
-- environment by the CLI; a function or a statement that mints accounts has no business running
-- anywhere automatically. This is a one-off script a human pastes, reads, and runs.
--
-- **NOT `supabase/seed.sql`.** That file is fixtures with known ids and known passwords and is for
-- development datastores only (ADR-024, ADR-030). This one takes what you give it and hard-codes
-- nothing.
--
-- **NOT `supabase/bootstrap.sql`.** That resolves a person who ALREADY signed up through the
-- interface and gives them the first team and the first admin row. This one creates the auth user,
-- which bootstrap deliberately refuses to do.
--
-- **IT WRITES A PASSWORD YOU TYPED INTO A SQL EDITOR.** That password is in your clipboard, in the
-- editor's history and possibly in a query log. Use it for test accounts. For a real person, let
-- them sign up through the application with an address that exists.
--
-- ============================================================================================
-- HOW TO APPLY IT — Supabase dashboard, SQL editor, as ONE submission
-- ============================================================================================
--
--   set calechip.new_email    = 'test1@calechip.com';
--   set calechip.new_password = 'password123';
--   set calechip.new_name     = 'Test One';   -- optional; the part before @ is used when empty
--   set calechip.new_avatar   = '';           -- optional; 🙂 when empty
--   set calechip.new_approved = 'no';         -- 'yes' puts them on the one team immediately
--   -- ...then paste everything below this header into the same submission and run it together.
--
-- The `set` statements and the block below MUST be one submission: a `set` lasts for the session,
-- and the dashboard opens a new one per run. This is `bootstrap.sql`'s own convention.
--
-- Run it again with a different address for the next account. Running it twice with the SAME
-- address raises rather than creating a second row — `auth.users` is unique on email, and a silent
-- `on conflict do nothing` would look like success.
--
-- **THE FOUR EMPTY STRINGS AT THE END OF THE INSERT ARE LOAD-BEARING.** `confirmation_token`,
-- `recovery_token`, `email_change_token_new` and `email_change` have no column default; left NULL,
-- GoTrue scans them into non-nullable Go strings and EVERY sign-in for that row fails with
-- `500 Database error querying schema`, while a sign-in for a user that does not exist still
-- returns 400 — so the account looks created and is permanently unusable. `.ai/board/model-debt.md`
-- MD-014, and `supabase/seed.sql:71-76` carries the same warning.
--
-- **NO `auth.identities` ROW IS WRITTEN, deliberately.** `seed.sql` writes none either and password
-- sign-in works for its accounts, including the operator's own admin account added on 2026-09-01.
-- That table's columns have changed across GoTrue versions, so a speculative insert here is a
-- statement that may not apply to the version your project is running.
