# non-VITE value in it) does not end up in the image. Only what the source actually reads as
# `import.meta.env.VITE_*` is inlined into the bundle — which is public by design.
#
# The ARGs remain for CI or one-off overrides. A variable defined in the secret file wins over the
# same --build-arg; a variable the file does not define is taken from the --build-arg.
