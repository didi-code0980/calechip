// Tests for check-docs.mjs.
//
// **D1, group prefixes.** D1 polices feature IDs against a machine-readable list declared in
// features.md. It ships empty, so the interesting cases are both directions: nothing declared means
// nothing checked, and a declared prefix means a dangling ID is reported even when its group table
// is bare — which is exactly the citation an agent writes when it has invented a feature.
//
// **D2, unissued IDs.** A document explaining why a number is missing has to be able to write that
// number. Before this, check-docs.mjs forced the author of `.ai/registry/invariants.md` to split the
// ID across two code spans to get past its own audit — a check editing the prose it is supposed to
// be measuring.
//
// **D11, ADRs cited by ID.** D6 only sees references written as paths. An ADR is cited as "ADR-002",
// so a decision could be cited by three documents while the file recording it did not exist — and
// the citation reads as evidence that somebody decided.
//
// **D12, declared boundaries.** An ADR that names a revert condition is only enforced if something
// looks. The boundary config makes that mechanical instead of remembered.
//
// These build a throwaway project and run the real script against it as a child process, the same
// way the hook tests do. They assert on findings for one check at a time: a minimal fixture trips
// several unrelated checks, so asserting on the exit code alone would pass for the wrong reason.
