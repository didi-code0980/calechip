// scripts/check-carry.mjs and the context builder behind it — ADR-043.
//
// **What is under test is the seam, not `planCarry` again.** `entry.test.mjs` already pins the
// carried/stray rules. What ADR-043 added is that review check R1 now reaches those rules through a
// command instead of through prose, so the assertions here are about the two things that can break
// between the rule and the reviewer: the context builder reading the right files off disk, and the
// CLI turning carried/stray into the right exit code.
//
// The case that motivated the ADR is the last test: a sibling BACKLOG shell from the same PROMOTE —
// the shape of `.ai/board/tickets/CAL-12/`, which R1 failed CAL-11 on while the runner's preflight,
// calling the same function, called it carried.
