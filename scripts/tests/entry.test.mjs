//
// **The resolver order is the thing under test, not the individual rules.** Step 5 is the one that
// matters: a string that looks like a ticket id but names no ticket is an ERROR and never falls
// through to "treat it as an idea". Falling through would turn one mistyped character into an idea
// file, a feature row and a ticket — three board and registry writes from a typo, with the operator
// finding out at the pull request.
//
// The other load-bearing assertion is that the verdict is read from front-matter. Before ADR-037
// there was nothing to read: `gate:` is `PASS` on every file in `.ai/board/ideas/` including the one
// that was REJECTed, so a run that trusted `gate` would have promoted a rejected idea.
