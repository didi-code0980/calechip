// check-carry.mjs — what review check R1 runs. ADR-043.
//
// R1 asks one question: is any path in this ticket's working tree outside what the Developer was
// allowed to write? Answering it needs two different rules, because the tree holds two different
// kinds of change.
//
//   - **Committed changes** go to `origin/main...HEAD` and are judged against `allowed_paths`, with
//     the ticket folder and the ship-owned set exempt (ADR-023 for CI, ADR-041 for R1). That half is
//     `scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs`, which runs in CI where it cannot be misreported.
//   - **Uncommitted changes** — modified and untracked — are what a ticket looks like for its whole
//     life, because agents commit only at `/ship` (ADR-023). They are judged by `planCarry`, which
//     is the same function the runner's preflight uses.
//
// **Before ADR-043 the second half had no reader at REVIEW**, so R1 judged uncommitted paths against
// `allowed_paths` too, and failed CAL-11 on `.ai/board/tickets/CAL-12/ticket.yaml` — a BACKLOG shell
// written by `/triage` from the same PROMOTE, which `/ship` never commits and CI therefore never
// sees. The runner's preflight had already classified that exact path as carried. Two readers of one
// tree, opposite verdicts, for the second time in two days; ADR-041 fixed the first instance by
// writing a prose exempt set, and that set was incomplete the day it was written. This file exists
// so the answer has one implementation rather than three prose copies of it.
//
// Run: node scripts/check-carry.mjs <TICKET-ID>
// Exit 0 when nothing is stray. Exit 1 and list the stray paths otherwise.
