// CAL-05 — the week view: who is away this week, for how much of each day, why, and who agreed.
// 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.2 and 4.3.
//
// **IT IS READ-ONLY, AND THAT IS THE FEATURE.** The registry row says *displaying who approved is
// not approving* and *no admin action reaches this surface*. There is no approve, no reject, no edit
// and no delete here, for either role, and there is no draft panel either — CAL-04's month cell
// carries the create path and a second one would be a second thing to keep in step with
// `entry_insert_own`. AC-8 is held by ABSENCE, which 01-plan.md section 3 names as the weakest
// mechanism in the plan: a reviewer checks it by reading the imports below and finding no write.
//
// **IT COUNTS, SINCE UIE-07 — AND THE TWO REASONS THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO GIVE FOR REFUSING WERE
// BOTH WRONG.** It said the count needed `seam.getTeam()` and that INV-04 stood in the way. Neither
// was true, and saying so is the point of this rewrite: ADR-029 requires the correction rather than
// a fresh description of the footer, so the next reader does not inherit the same wrong reason in
// new words.
//
// - **A count never needed a team read.** `getTeam()` supplies `overloadThreshold`, and a bare
//   `n/N` does not use it. The denominator is `currentMemberCount(roster)` over the roster this
//   screen ALREADY reads, so the fourth read the old sentence feared was never on the path.
// - **INV-04 was never the obstacle.** CAL-05's own plan says so at its `01-plan.md:528-531`. The
//   invariant forbids a SECOND DEFINITION, not a second SCREEN — `absenceCountsFor` is the same
//   function the month grid calls, so putting its answer here is reuse and not divergence. ADR-029
//   records INV-04 as SATISFIED by this decision rather than amended.
//
// **WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE, AND CLAUSE 3 KEEPS IT THAT WAY: this screen computes no overload state,
// reads no threshold, and does not call `seam.getTeam()`.** The strip is two numbers and a slash;
// it divides nothing and carries no colour that means a state.
//
// **AND THE WARNING BELOW IS NOW MORE LOAD-BEARING, NOT LESS.** Every row drawn comes from
// `absentEntriesFor` and every count from `absenceCountsFor`, two derivations from INV-04's one
// pass; a `.filter(e => e.status !== ...)` — or a local sum over `absent` — written anywhere in this
// file would be the second definition INV-04 exists to forbid. It used to be the reason for a
// refusal. It is now the guard rail on UIE-07 AC-5, and the divergence the feature row names — four
// names against 3.5 — is invisible on either screen alone.
//
// **INV-06 IS VISIBLE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE.** A five-day `pm` entry is five afternoons, not a
// half-day at one end, because `portion` is one value applying to every date in the range. This view
// chooses nothing about that: it reads `entry.portion` on every row it draws, which is what makes
// the rendering unable to contradict the column shape CAL-01 shipped (AC-4).
//
// Colour, and where it comes from. `.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md` § Colour is still
// `TODO(project)`, so the palette is cited to `CLAUDE.md` § Visual direction, the only place in the
// repository that carries it: PTO peach, WFH mint, tentative dashed at reduced opacity, approved
// carrying a small star. No overload pink appears here at all, because no overload state is
// computed. Holidays are lavender, and CAL-08 draws them HERE — the sentence this replaces said
// they were not drawn on this screen, and that ticket is the one that spends it. Lavender means NOT
// WORKING and tints the DAY HEADING only; the rows below are untouched. A bridge day is a working
// day, gets no lavender, and carries an outlined badge instead (glossary.md, CAL-08 01-plan.md
// § 2b). 01-plan.md § 2b records that no image was attached at either stage and that the arrangement
// below is the Tech Lead's own.
//
// UIE-04 — **the seven days are a GRID above 1280px and the shipped stack below it, and nothing else
// on this screen changed.** 01-plan.md § 4.2, § 4.3 and § 4.4. Two properties below are decisions
// rather than defaults, and both are worth knowing before editing the layout.
//
// **THE COLUMNS DO NOT FILL THE VIEWPORT AND NO COLUMN SCROLLS ON ITS OWN** (AC-4, AC-5).
// **UIE-05 REVERSED THE FIRST HALF OF THAT SENTENCE AND NOT THE SECOND — see the UIE-05 block
// below.** The
// transcription shows seven columns with a crisp bottom edge — on an EMPTY week, which is the one
// case in which that property costs nothing. At ~161px a column a chip is 90-110px tall, and one
// member may hold an `am` AND a `pm` entry on one date, so sixteen chips on one day is ~1520px of
// content in ~910px of body. Seven independent scrollers would put the days out of horizontal
// register, and a day whose entries all sat below its own fold would read as a quiet day — the
// opposite of what this screen is for. The pane scrolls once instead, and a column is as tall as
// the busiest day.
//
// **THE FOOTER STRIP THIS TICKET REFUSED IS NOW BUILT — UIE-07 — BUT ITS REFUSAL OF THE CHIP COUNT
// STANDS AND IS THE ARGUMENT THE STRIP RESTS ON.** The transcription draws an absence-count footer
// under every column; UIE-04 refused it, and refused triage's cheaper suggestion with it — the
// day's own CHIP count — because a day holding one full-day and two half-day entries has three
// chips and an absence count of two, so the number would contradict the month grid for the same
// date. That is INV-04's forbidden second definition, reached without ever opening `absence.ts`.
// **THAT SENTENCE IS STILL TRUE AND IS WHY UIE-07 AC-5 EXISTS**: the number in the strip comes from
// `absenceCountsFor` and from nothing on this screen — not the chip count, not the number of
// people, not a sum over `absent`.
//
// What is no longer true is the conclusion UIE-04 drew from it. It ended *a column ends where its
// content ends*; a column now ends with `week-day-count`, pinned by `mt-auto`, on every one of the
// seven days including a day with nobody away.
//
// UIE-05 — **the column FILLS the viewport, and the header strip and the entry chip are restacked.**
// 01-plan.md § 4.2 to § 4.5. A second image was drawn hours after UIE-04 merged; three of its four
// asks are built here and four are refused. Nothing outside this file is opened.
//
// **THE FILL IS `min-height` AND NEVER `height`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF WHY UIE-04's TWO
// ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA SURVIVE IT.** UIE-04's PROSE, four paragraphs up, said the columns do not fill
// the viewport; this ticket reverses that prose deliberately and says so rather than quietly doing
// the opposite of a shipped decision. It reverses NEITHER AC-4 (every entry reachable by scrolling
// the PAGE, no column scrollbar, nothing clipped) NOR AC-5 (the seven stay in horizontal register):
// a column at LEAST the pane tall and free to grow past it renders the image on a quiet week and
// behaves exactly as those two require on a busy one. A fixed `height` would clip a busy column or
// introduce a second scroller, which is why it is not used. **UIE-04's three rejected alternatives
// are untouched** — seven independently scrolling columns are still refused, for the reason above.
//
// **THE COST, ACCEPTED: on a busy week anything pinned to the bottom of a column goes below the fold
// with that column.** **UIE-07 IS WHAT PINS SOMETHING THERE** — `week-day-count` sits on the
// column's bottom edge via `mt-auto`, so on a busy week it goes below the fold with the rest of that
// column, exactly as this paragraph predicted. That cost was accepted again by ADR-029, and pinning
// to the VIEWPORT is still a different feature that is not proposed anywhere.
//
// **THE CHIP KEEPS ALL FIVE OF THE FACTS THE IMAGE DROPS, AND THAT IS THE TICKET'S ONE REAL
// DECISION.** The image's chip is a ~44px two-line stack carrying an avatar, a name, a star and a
// type code, and nothing else. Each of the five it drops is load-bearing: the portion pill is
// INV-06's only visible surface in the product; the note is CAL-05 AC-6; the word `Tentative` is
// AC-9's ACCESSIBLE half, said in words for somebody who cannot see the dashed border;
// `Approved by <name>` is what CAL-05's registry row is actually about, since a bare star says only
// that SOMEBODY approved and `approved_by` is v1's only audit trail; and `Leave` / `Working from
// home` is OPS-002 AC-7, which requires every screen naming a type to state that the member is
// WORKING — a bare `WFH` states nothing. **UIE-04 refused this same deletion as its Option 2, even
// behind an expand where the information still existed; the image deletes it outright.** So the
// SILHOUETTE is reproduced — a three-row stack with a circular avatar bubble and the star beside the
// name — and the five facts are DEMOTED to a third line at reduced size rather than removed. Every
// one of them renders AT REST: no hover, no click, no expansion.
//
// **IT IS THEREFORE TWO OR THREE LINES TALL AND NOT THE IMAGE'S ~44px.** Those two are not
// simultaneously satisfiable and 01-plan.md Open question 2 records the choice as made rather than
// missed.
//
// **THE COUNT UIE-05 DEFERRED IS BUILT, AND SO IS THE COUPLING IT RECORDED — UIE-07.** The second
// image draws `n/8 vắng` under every column. ADR-029 was ACCEPTED on 2026-09-08 and UIE-07 builds
// the strip, but **not that label and not that denominator**: the denominator is COMPUTED and the
// fixtures give 4, and the word is refused on clause 4 and on § Language, so the visible strip is
// `n/N` with the glossary's English term in the accessible reading only. UIE-05's refusal of the
// chip count as an approximation is untouched and is now AC-5.
//
// **THE COUPLING IS RESOLVED, AND `"Everybody is in."` STAYS.** This paragraph recorded that the
// sentence and the count are decided together, since a footer reading `0/4` is what would make
// deleting the sentence defensible. UIE-07's 01-plan.md § 8 alternative 1 took that decision and
// declined the deletion, on geometry rather than test cost: the sentence renders only when a column
// is empty, and the strip pins to the bottom of a column at least a viewport tall, so **the two are
// only ever co-visible on a column with nothing else in it** — the redundancy costs a row exactly
// where there is spare room. So `week-day-empty` keeps its element, its selector and its SENTENCE,
// and `tests/e2e/cal-05-week-view.spec.ts` is unedited. The middle path — keeping the element and
// emptying it — was refused for this file's own recorded reason further down: an empty third row is
// a line of padding that claims a fact exists.
//
// **THE RADIUS IS `rounded-2xl` AND NOT A CHANGE TO `--radius-card`.** `rounded-card` (26px) is
// SHARED with AuthCard.tsx and Sidebar.tsx, both out of scope, so moving the token would repaint two
// screens this ticket may not touch — the same collision src/index.css:117-123 already records one
// token over. A `--radius-day` token was rejected for having exactly one consumer. The consequence,
// accepted: the day column and the sign-in card now have different corner radii.

  // What it does now: patch `busyDays` IN PLACE through `withOwnBusyMark` — `phase` stays `ready`,
  // so nothing unmounts and the three `useMemo`s below recompute the count, the avatars and my own

  //
  // **THE COST, ACCEPTED: the figure is briefly one this screen predicted rather than one the
  // datastore produced.** The prediction is exact for the caller's own row and blind to everybody
  // else's — `withOwnBusyMark` carries why that is all a press can know — so a date somebody else
  // marked in the meantime reads one short until the next read of the range. The operator chose
  // immediacy over that, for a number nobody acts on within the second it is stale.
  //
  // **A REFUSED WRITE REVERTS, AND IT CHECKS THE RESULT TO KNOW.** `setOwnBusyDay` returns a
  // `Result` and the old code discarded it, which was harmless while every press ended in a re-read
  // and is not harmless now: a discarded refusal would leave a mark on screen that the datastore
  // never took. A throw reverts the same way. The revert restores the exact array captured before
  // the press rather than recomputing one, so a second press mid-flight cannot resurrect a row.

          `week-anchor` still carries `data-week-start` set to the same Monday this screen computed,
          which is why the 43 references that read it need no edit.

          The day list below is untouched, CAL-08's cell selectors included (AC-10). */}

      {/* CAL-05 AC-13. Seven sections, always. A week that hid its quiet days would make "nobody is

          the other. `xl` is Tailwind's 1280px and is the breakpoint 01-plan.md § 4.2 originates —
          nothing in the repository stated one before (`.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md:165` is a
          bare `TODO(project)` for exactly this), which 01-plan.md Open question 1 records.

          `grid-cols-7` is `repeat(7, minmax(0, 1fr))`, so the seven tracks are EQUAL and each may
          shrink below its content — that `minmax(0, ...)`, with `min-w-0` on the day itself, is
          what keeps a long note inside its column instead of widening the pane (AC-15). `gap-2` is
          the transcription's ~8px gutter. Nothing here sets `overflow`: a column is as tall as the
          busiest day and the PANE scrolls, once, for all seven (UIE-04 AC-4, AC-5). */}
      {/* UIE-05 AC-1 and AC-3. **`xl:min-h-full`, and it is a MINIMUM.** The sentence above used to
          read "nothing here sets a height"; a minimum is what lets a quiet week reach the bottom of
          the pane without taking the busy week's freedom to grow past it, which is why UIE-04's AC-4
          and AC-5 survive the reversal of its prose (see the UIE-05 block at the top of this file).

          **01-plan.md OPEN QUESTION 1 ASKED WHETHER A PERCENTAGE RESOLVES THROUGH THIS CHAIN OR
          NEEDS AN EXPLICIT `calc(...)`, AND LEFT IT TO THIS STAGE BECAUSE IT NEEDS A RENDERED
          VIEWPORT. IT WAS RENDERED AND MEASURED, AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THE PERCENTAGE RESOLVES.**
          The chain is App.tsx:82 `<main class="flex min-h-screen flex-col">` -> AppShell.tsx:33
          `flex min-h-0 flex-1` -> :40 the pane, `flex min-w-0 flex-1 flex-col overflow-y-auto` ->
          :42 `min-w-0 flex-1 px-6 pb-6` -> this screen. That last div is a flex ITEM whose height
          the flex algorithm resolves, which is what a percentage below it resolves against — so
          `xl:h-full` on the section and on the positioning wrapper carries a definite height down to
          this grid, and `min-h-full` here is the pane minus the top bar and the pane's own `pb-6`.

          **THE `calc(100vh - 70px - 1.5rem)` THE PLAN NAMED AS THE FALLBACK WAS WRITTEN FIRST, AND
          MEASURING IT IS WHAT REJECTED IT.** It is right only when this grid's top edge is exactly
          the top bar's height, and it is not: App.tsx:88 renders `seam-banner` ABOVE the shell on
          every build resolving to the mock seam, which is every build the acceptance suite drives.
          Measured at 1280x800 the calc put the columns' bottom edge at 856px against an 800px
          viewport — 56px BELOW the fold, with the document scrolling 80px on a week where nobody is
          away, which is the opposite of AC-1. **A percentage is offset-independent and absorbs that
          banner without knowing it exists**: the same measurement gives a bottom edge of 776px, plus
          the pane's 24px of `pb-6`, which is exactly 800.

          Measured with the same probe, and these are AC-2 and AC-3: at a viewport short enough to
          overflow, the seven columns are 533px inside a 270px pane — they grow past it, the PAGE
          scrolls, no column scrolls itself, and all seven keep one top and one height.

          **`xl:` AND NOT BARE**, because below 1280px there are no columns to fill — the stacked
          layout UIE-04 originated is untouched, and a min-height there would push a two-entry week
          onto a page that scrolls for nothing. Measured at 1024px: the seven stack at their content
          height and nothing fills. */}
      {/* `xl:h-full` for the reason on the section above — the second link in the chain. On a busy
          week this wrapper is SHORTER than the grid it holds, which is intended and costs nothing:
          nothing here sets `overflow`, and the only thing positioned against it is the mascot, which
          is drawn on empty weeks only, where the two heights are the same. */}

                {/* SOLO, 2026-09-11 — the busy strip, and the control that writes it.
                    The operator: *"cho phép user mark ngày cụ thể nào đó là bận, người khác sẽ thấy
                    được số member bận trong ngày đó"*, so that somebody arranging an event can see
                    which days are heavy. They chose a press on the day itself, and count PLUS names.

                    **`mt-auto` IS HERE AND THE COUNT STRIP BELOW GAVE UP ITS OWN, WHICH IS THE ONE
                    CHARACTER OF UIE-07's ELEMENT THIS CHANGE TOUCHES.** Written first with BOTH
                    carrying it, and a screenshot is what rejected that: CSS distributes free space
                    EQUALLY among every auto margin in the box, so two `mt-auto` siblings take half
                    the slack each and this pill floated in the middle of the column with the strip
                    still at the bottom. One auto margin pins the pair. `week-day-count` keeps its
                    id, its text, its `data-current-members` and its whole appearance — UIE-07
                    asserts those and asserts no class, so every one of its criteria still passes.

                    **ONE ELEMENT IS BOTH THE FIGURE AND THE CONTROL.** A separate "mark busy" button
                    beside a separate number would spend two rows of a 161px column on one fact.
                    `aria-pressed` is what makes the button a toggle to a screen reader rather than
                    an action with a surprising result.

                    **IT IS NOT THE OVERLOAD STATE AND NOT THE ABSENCE COUNT.** Butter, not pink and
                    not peach: UIE-06 § 4.6 refused giving one colour two meanings on one grid, and a
                    busy person is at work — the opposite of what every other colour on this screen
                    means. `src/index.css` carries the token's reasoning.

                    **THE NAMES ARE AVATARS, NOT A LIST.** The column is ~161px wide and a stacked
                    list of display names is the density CLAUDE.md § Visual direction says the grid
                    never pays. Each avatar carries `title` and `data-member-id`, which is how the
                    month cell already names the people it draws. */}

                        new one when this appears, because the press is optimistic; swapping the
                        figure out for a spinner would hide the very thing the press just changed,
                        and would also change the pill's width mid-press. What it says is "the write
                        is still in flight", which is the only fact the button still owes. */}

                {/* UIE-07 AC-1, AC-7, AC-8, AC-10, AC-11. THE MIRROR OF THE HEADER STRIP above —
                    same full-bleed negative margin, same hairline token, same centred small type,
                    `border-t` and `rounded-b-2xl` where the header has `border-b` and
                    `rounded-t-2xl`. No token is added: `--color-line` and `--color-ink-3` both
                    already exist (src/index.css:104, :109), so src/index.css is not opened.

                    `mt-auto` IS THE PIN AND IT NEEDS NO WRAPPER. UIE-05 shipped `xl:grid
                    xl:min-h-full` on the grid with each day a `flex min-w-0 flex-col` section, so
                    grid items stretch and the auto margin eats the slack — the strip sits on the
                    column's bottom edge whatever the tallest day is. Below `xl` the stack is
                    content-height and `mt-auto` is inert, which is the correct behaviour there.

                    IT RENDERS ALWAYS, INCLUDING `0/N`, and that is a decision rather than the
                    month's default: `month-cell-count` renders only when `count > 0`, and following
                    that here would make the strip vanish on all seven columns of an empty week
                    (AC-7). On a quiet week a column therefore reads label / "Everybody is in." / a
                    gap / `0/4`, which is the accepted cost of keeping that sentence.

                    NO NOUN IS VISIBLE (AC-10). ADR-029 clause 4 forbids `vắng`, and its other half —
                    the glossary's own English term — carries the same claim about a member working
                    from home that the clause exists to prevent (glossary.md, "Absence count"; and
                    src/lib/labels.ts calls that the most costly confusion in this domain). So the
                    visible strip is two numbers and a slash, which also spends the least density on
                    the screen CLAUDE.md § Visual direction is written about, and the glossary's
                    exact English term is in the ACCESSIBLE reading only. An `aria-label` on the `<p>`
                    is deliberately not used: the sr-only span adds the name to the reading order
                    without overriding the numbers.

                    TWO NUMBERS AND A SLASH, NEVER A PERCENTAGE, AND NO SPECIAL CASE AT `N = 0`
                    (AC-8, AC-9). Under ADR-013 the numerator is DATE-SENSITIVE while the denominator
                    is READ-TIME, a consequence INV-04 records as accepted, so on a past week after a
                    removal `n` can exceed `N`, and `N` can be 0 while `n` is not. THIS IS THE FIRST
                    SURFACE THAT JUXTAPOSES THEM. Nothing here divides, so it is a display oddity and
                    not a defect — and dividing is exactly where an oddity becomes a NaN on screen,
                    which is why `isOverloaded` guards `currentMembers <= 0` before it and why this
                    element does not need to.

                    NO ROUNDING, AND THAT IS INV-06 (AC-3, AC-8). A half day weighs 0.5, so `{count}`
                    renders `0.5` and `1` — never `1.0`, never `Math.round(count)`, never `toFixed`.
                    The chip above carries `week-row-portion`, INV-06's only visible surface in the
                    product (UIE-05), and a strip reading `1` beside a pill reading `Morning` would
                    make the screen contradict itself about the invariant on the one screen that
                    shows it.

                    IT IS NOT THE OVERLOAD STATE (AC-11). No threshold, no `seam.getTeam()`, no
                    overload attribute, and no pink — pink is `--color-overload`, and UIE-06 already
                    refused painting it on a working day for giving one colour two meanings on one
                    grid. ADR-029 clause 3 forbids anything overload-shaped here independently.

                    IT ADDS NO CONTROL (AC-12). A `<p>` holding two `<span>`s is none of the five
                    elements cal-05-week-view.spec.ts forbids inside a `week-day`, so CAL-05 AC-8's
                    absence mechanism survives untouched and that spec file stays unedited. */}

        {/* AC-11 and AC-12. The mascot, and it is the whole of what UIE-04 adds to this screen's
            content. It floats OVER the columns rather than inside one — the transcription puts it
            across the fourth — so it is a sibling of the grid, absolutely positioned over it, and
            `pointer-events-none` keeps it from being a target on a screen that has none.

            `hidden xl:flex` is AC-11's "in the seven-column layout": below the breakpoint the seven
            per-day empty states ARE the screen and a card has nothing to float over.

            IT CARRIES NO LINK AND NO BUTTON (AC-12). The transcription's create link is refused in

            route, so a second control to `/entries/new` either duplicates an id or gives the
            product two names for one destination. The sentence is ENGLISH (§ Language, AC-16) —
            the transcription's is Vietnamese and this is the one string on this screen a developer
            would copy from it rather than from the file.
