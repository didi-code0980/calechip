  // driving the real build with the flag off, and by nothing in the suite, because the suite pins
  // the flag on.
  //
  // `<Navigate>` AND NOT `useNavigate` IN THE HANDLER: this is the same shape `/signin` uses one
  // route over for the same situation (`App.tsx:134-142`), a redirect expressed as what the screen
  // renders rather than as a side effect of a click. `replace` so the browser Back button does not
  // return to a sign-up form for an account that now exists.

            UIE-01 AC-9 — THE PICKER SURVIVES THE RESTYLE AS A PICKER. The reference shows no avatar
            selection at all, and removing it would break TEA-01's AC-8, the `complete` gate above
            and four assertions in tests/e2e/tea-01-signup.spec.ts. A card ~355px wide has no room
            for a wrapping grid of swatches, so it becomes ONE horizontally scrollable row at the
            same 44px rhythm as the inputs — the first swatch is reachable without scrolling, which
            is what the `.first().click()` in that spec depends on.

            `py-1` on the scroller is not spacing: the selected swatch's ring sits OUTSIDE its box,
            and an `overflow-x-auto` container with no vertical padding clips it.

            `min-w-0` ON THE FIELDSET IS LOAD-BEARING AND WAS FOUND BY LOOKING, NOT BY REASONING.
            A fieldset carries `min-inline-size: min-content` in the UA stylesheet, so it refuses to
            shrink below its widest content — twelve 44px swatches. Without this the strip does not
            scroll, it pushes the CARD wider than the viewport and the whole page scrolls sideways,
            which is exactly what AC-16 forbids. */}
