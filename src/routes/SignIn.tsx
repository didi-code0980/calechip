// TEA-05 — the sign-in screen. 01-plan.md sections 4.4 and 8.
//
// Everything here is an affordance (ADR-005). Authentication is not authorization: this screen
// establishes WHO the caller is, and every policy already written decides what that identity may do.
// It adds no permission and changes no row of the table in .ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md.
//
// On success it renders nothing of its own. The seam notifies, `useSession` re-resolves, and
// `App.tsx` routes away — which is why there is no navigation call anywhere in this file.
//
// RESTYLED BY UIE-01 AND NOTHING BELOW THE SURFACE MOVED (AC-18). The seam call at `signIn(...)`,
// the form state machine, the refusal handling and all four `sign-in-*` selectors are exactly what
// TEA-05 shipped. What changed is the markup around them and the classes on it.

      // for both; `email_not_confirmed` is its own, because sending somebody to reset a password
      // that is correct is the more expensive help.

  //
  // UIE-01 AC-10: the four `sign-in-*` names below are frozen. Renaming one would pull twelve spec
  // files into this ticket — eight of them only because each carries a local `signIn(page, email)`
  // helper filling these three ids — and seventeen files is L, which must split.

/* THERE IS NOW A LINK TO /signup, AND THIS COMMENT RECORDS THE REVERSAL RATHER THAN THE DECISION IT
   REPLACES. What stood here through TEA-05 said the absence of such a link was deliberate, citing
   that ticket's 01-plan.md section 1 — "nothing else navigates", with the single admin-only
   /allow-list link on the landing screen as the one link the feature row permitted.

   UIE-01 SUPERSEDES IT. The segmented control in AuthCard is that link, in both directions, and
   01-plan.md section 4.5 requires this comment to be rewritten in the same ticket rather than left
   standing to contradict the code beside it — a developer who found it and obeyed it would not
   build AC-4.

   WHY THE REVERSAL IS NOT ADR-LEVEL, which is the part worth keeping: the control adds no
   permission and reveals nothing. /signup is ALREADY reachable by address in every membership state
   (App.tsx:68, ADR-009 — somebody who signed up before being allow-listed has an auth user and no
   member row), so this adds a second route to a destination that was never guarded. It is a static
   link, rendered identically for everyone, before anybody is anybody, and it discloses no fact
   about any address. The guard on /signin itself is untouched. */
