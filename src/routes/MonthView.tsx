// CAL-04 — the month grid: who is away on each day, and which days are crowded.
// 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3 and 4.
//
// EVERYTHING here is an affordance (ADR-005). This screen holds no control at all, and that is
// unusually literal: it issues three reads and one create, and every one of them is decided in the
// datastore. `entry_select_team` and `member_select_team` are AC-12, `team_select_own` — shipped by
// this ticket's migration — is AC-14's read half, and `entry_insert_own` is what decides the write
// the drag-select form issues. This component refuses nobody holding a token.
//
// **IT COMPUTES NO COUNT OF ITS OWN.** Every number on screen comes from `absenceCountsFor` in
// @/lib/data/absence, which is INV-04's single implementation. A `.filter(e => e.status !== ...)`
// written anywhere in this file would be a second copy of that rule, which is the exact failure
// INV-04 exists to prevent. The same goes for `isOverloaded`: the comparison is strictly greater and
// it is written once, there.
//
// **AND IT SETS NO THRESHOLD (AC-14).** `Set the overload threshold` is ADM-01's and
// rbac-and-security.md:47-48 grants the read to both roles and the write to `admin` alone. There is
// no control on this screen for either role, and the migration grants no `update` to anyone.
//
// **THE TWO ROLES ARE IDENTICAL HERE**, which is a first in this product. A reviewer scanning for a
// missing `is_admin` check should find that absence deliberate: 01-plan.md section 3 is ✅✅ or ❌❌ on
// every row.
//
// Colour, and where it comes from. `.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md` § Colour is still
// `TODO(project)`, so the palette below is cited to `CLAUDE.md` § Visual direction, which is the only
// place in the repository that carries it: PTO peach, WFH mint, an overloaded day a soft pink that is
// deliberately not an alarming red, tentative entries dashed at reduced opacity, approved ones
// carrying a small star. 01-plan.md § 2b records that citation and why it is honest rather than lazy.
// Holidays are lavender, and CAL-08 draws them HERE — the sentence above this one used to say they
// were not drawn on this screen, and that ticket is the one that spends it. Lavender means NOT
// WORKING: a bridge day is a working day, gets none of it, and carries an outlined badge instead
// (glossary.md, and CAL-08 01-plan.md § 2b). The overloaded soft pink still wins the background, so
// an overloaded holiday is pink AND named — a colour that hid the crowded-day signal would be the
// suppression ADR-015 forbids (CAL-08 AC-10). There is no density toggle: it is named in CLAUDE.md,
// specified nowhere, and originating one would be inventing a control rather than a layout (§ 2b).
//
// UIE-06 — **THE GRID BECOMES ONE RULED FULL-WIDTH CARD WITH TALLER CELLS, PAINTED FROM THE
// PRODUCT'S OWN TOKENS.** Five changes, every one of them arrangement:
//
//   - the `mx-auto max-w-5xl` cap is gone (AC-1). AppShell.tsx:40-42 already grants the width,
//     YearView never capped itself, and UIE-04 deleted the identical cap from the week view. This
//     was the last calendar surface still drawing itself 1024px wide inside a ~1563px pane.
//   - the seven weekday labels LEFT `month-grid` and sit on the page ground above the card (AC-2).
//     They keep `month-weekday` and they keep reading Mon…Sun — `T2`…`CN` is Vietnamese and
//     .ai/standards/ui-design-system.md:46-48 is the operator's own instruction against it.
//   - 35 `rounded-xl` tiles separated by `gap-1` gutters became ONE `rounded-card` surface whose
//     cells are separated by 1px `--color-line` hairlines (AC-3). `overflow-hidden` is what rounds
//     the four outer corners and leaves every cell rectangular.
//   - cells are at least 170px tall and the card fills the pane on a five-row month (AC-4). **A
//     MINIMUM, never a height** — a six-row month is ~1020px of cells against a ~1010px viewport, so
//     a card that FILLED the viewport would clip a week roughly half the year (01-plan.md § 4.4).
//   - **THE SIX FRAMEWORK DEFAULTS BECAME TOKENS** (AC-7, AC-8). `bg-white` -> `bg-card`,
//     `bg-slate-100/60` -> `bg-bg`, `bg-violet-100` -> `bg-holiday`, `bg-orange-100` -> `bg-pto`,
//     `bg-emerald-100` -> `bg-wfh`, `bg-rose-100` -> `bg-overload`. The last token did not exist;
//     UIE-06 § 4.6 adds it at exactly `rose-100`'s value, so no pixel changes colour. This closes
//     the defect § 1 names: Sidebar.tsx:68-70 draws the legend from `bg-pto`/`bg-wfh`/`bg-holiday`,
//     so **the legend and the grid it explains were painted from two different palettes, side by
//     side, permanently.**
//
// **THE OUT-OF-MONTH TINT IS `--color-bg` AND IS NEVER `--color-holiday`** (AC-5). The image tints
// those cells pale lavender, and lavender is spent: CLAUDE.md § Visual direction fixes it to
// holidays and CAL-08 spends `--color-holiday` there and nowhere else. CAL-08 AC-14 keeps
// out-of-month cells stateless, so an out-of-month holiday is not tinted — take the image literally
// and an out-of-month 30th and an in-month non-working holiday become the same colour with only a
// greyed numeral between them. The transcription's own § 1.3 calls the page ground "a pale lavender
// off-white", which is `--color-bg` and is not `#c9bff0`.
//
// **AND FOUR THINGS THE IMAGE ASKS FOR THAT ARE REFUSED**, each in 01-plan.md § 1: deleting
// `month-cell-count` (it is INV-04's agreement with the faces and INV-06's ONLY surface on this
// screen — ADR-031 is PROPOSED and this ticket neither waits on it nor anticipates it), deleting
// `month-threshold`, filling the bridge badge with pink (pink is the overload fill, and a second
// meaning for it on one grid is worse than an outline), and translating any copy into Vietnamese.

  // the width at `min-w-0 flex-1`; nothing was added to the shell.
  //
  // **`h-full`, AND 01-plan.md OPEN QUESTION 1 IS ANSWERED BY MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN BY READING.**
  // The plan left this declaration to this stage because it needs a rendered viewport, and it was
  // rendered. **THE PERCENTAGE RESOLVES.** The chain is App.tsx:82 `flex min-h-screen flex-col` ->
  // AppShell.tsx:33 `flex min-h-0 flex-1` -> :40 the pane `flex min-w-0 flex-1 flex-col
  // overflow-y-auto` -> :42 `min-w-0 flex-1 px-6 pb-6` -> this screen. That last div is a flex ITEM
  // whose height the flex algorithm resolves, which is what a percentage below it resolves against
  // — the same chain and the same answer UIE-05 measured for the week column, and no
  // `calc(100vh - 70px - 1.5rem)` is needed. A calc would be wrong here for UIE-05's reason too:
  // App.tsx:88 renders `seam-banner` ABOVE the shell on every mock build, which is every build the
  // acceptance suite drives, so this screen's top edge is 80px down rather than the top bar's 70px.
  // A percentage absorbs that offset without knowing it exists.
  //
  // **`min-h-full` WAS WRITTEN FIRST AND MEASURING IS WHAT REJECTED IT.** A percentage MINIMUM on a
  // box whose own height is indefinite resolves to `auto`, so the flex column below had no free
  // space to hand out and `auto-rows-[minmax(170px,1fr)]` never reached its `1fr`: measured at
  // 1563x1440 a five-row April stopped at 854px of cells with 244px of empty pane under it, which
  // is AC-4's first clause failing. With `h-full` the same month measures 218.8px cells and a card
  // bottom of 1324px in a 1360px pane — the 36px left is `month-empty`, which is a sibling below
  // the card. September, which HAS entries and so draws no empty sentence, measures a card bottom
  // of 1416px against a pane bottom of 1440px, which is exactly the pane's own `pb-6`.
  //
  // **AND THE CLIPPING THIS COMMENT ONCE FEARED FROM `h-full` DOES NOT HAPPEN**, which is the other
  // half of what was measured. `h-full` is a hard height and the card below carries
  // `overflow-hidden` — but the card is a flex ITEM whose `min-height: auto` is its content, so a
  // six-row month makes the CARD 1025px tall and it overflows this section rather than being cut by
  // it. Probed at 1563x1010 and at 1280x800: `card.scrollHeight === card.clientHeight` on every
  // five- and six-row month tried, cells hold their 170px, and the page scrolls (AC-4's second
  // clause). Nothing scrolls inside the card.

          the flex algorithm hands it whatever height is left after the header — which is the
          subtraction a percentage cannot do. Its default `min-height: auto` is what stops it
          shrinking below the card inside it, and it is why a six-row month grows the section rather

                      The operator's purpose: somebody arranging an event needs to see which days are
                      heavy, where "heavy" means people who are AT WORK with their hands full.

                      **ONE ELEMENT IS BOTH THE FIGURE AND THE CONTROL**, the same choice
                      `WeekView.tsx` records: a separate button beside a separate number would spend
                      two of a cell's few lines on one fact, on the screen CLAUDE.md § Visual
                      direction says information density wins every time.

                      **IT DOES NOT REPLACE `month-cell-count` AND IS NEVER ADDED TO IT.** That
                      number is INV-04's absence count and drives the crowded-day fill; this one
                      counts people who are present. Two numbers in one cell is the honest rendering
                      of two different facts, and butter is a fifth colour precisely so neither can
                      be mistaken for the other (`src/index.css`).

                      **IT IS DRAWN ONLY WHEN SOMEBODY IS BUSY, OR WHEN IT IS MINE TO UNSET** — the
                      rule `month-cell-count` already follows (`count > 0`), for the reason UIE-07
                      gives for departing from it in the week: a control on all 35 cells of a quiet
                      month is 35 pieces of furniture for a feature nobody used that month. An empty
                      cell's press target is the cell itself, which opens the entry form; marking a
                      day busy from a month with no marks starts in the week view, which draws the
                      control on all seven days.

                      **`onMouseDown` STOPS PROPAGATION, AND WITHOUT THAT LINE THE CONTROL IS
                      UNUSABLE.** The cell starts a date-range drag on mouse down (AC-13); a press on
                      a button inside it would both toggle the mark AND open the entry form on a
                      one-day range. `stopPropagation` on the button is the narrowest fix — the cell
                      keeps its gesture everywhere else in its own area. */}

                            part of the same fact.

                            SOLO, 2026-09-11 (second pass) — the spinner sits BESIDE the number and
                            does not replace it, for the reason the week's control records: the press
                            is optimistic, so the figure is already the new one when this appears and
                            swapping it out would hide the thing that just changed.

                            **THE BADGE CAN VANISH UNDER THE SPINNER, AND THAT IS CORRECT.** Unsetting
                            my own mark on a day nobody else marked drops `busyCount` to 0 and
                            `iAmBusy` to false, and the enclosing test renders nothing — so the
                            spinner leaves with the badge rather than spinning over a cell with no
                            number left to wait for. A refused write puts both back. */}
