// UIE-09 — the admin hub. 01-plan.md § 4.4, § 4.5 and § 4.6.
//
// EVERYTHING IN THIS FILE IS AN AFFORDANCE (ADR-005), AND IT IS A WEAKER ONE THAN USUAL: the screen
// renders five LINKS and nothing else. The five destinations keep their own guards, their own
// refusals and their own row-level security exactly as they had them before this file existed, so
// nothing here is the control for anything — a caller who reached one of those addresses by typing
// it is refused by the screen at the far end, not by the absence of a row in the list below.
//
// **NO WRITE FUNCTION FROM THE SEAM IS IMPORTED, AND THAT IS CHECKABLE BY READING ONE LINE.**
// `seam.getCurrentMember` is the only member of `seam` this file names (01-plan.md § 4.4), which is
// what makes AC-6's denial — a member sees NONE of the five destinations — a property of the file
// rather than a claim about it.
//
// **THE HUB IS A LIST AND NEVER A DASHBOARD.** It renders no count, no status and no summary of
// anything behind its five links, so it has one read, one refusal and no arithmetic. 01-plan.md § 2,
// the one assumption that ships: the moment it summarises something it acquires a seam read per
// destination and a partial failure state, which is `ticket.yaml` § 9's named size risk and is a
// different ticket.
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";
// SOLO, 2026-09-12. **THE `admin-hub-back` LINKS ARE GONE, AND THIS TIME IT IS A DECISION.** The
// note that stood here recorded a removal on 2026-09-10 that had been reverted, and set the test for
// telling the two apart: *"a removal that skipped its own sibling and left three criteria asserting
// the opposite reads as an oversight, not a decision. If it was a decision, deleting these four
// lines and flipping those three assertions is the whole of it."* The operator instructed the
// removal in words on 2026-09-12, all FOURTEEN links went in one sweep across all six admin screens,
// and the eleven assertions that followed one were rewritten with it. Neither half of that test is
// met any more.
//
// **WHAT REPLACES IT WAS ALREADY THERE**, which is why the link was redundant rather than merely
// unwanted: `TopBar.tsx:75-80` says in terms that its one control *"standing on any of the six admin
// screens is the way back to the calendar"*, and the top bar renders above every screen inside the
// shell. A second way out, in prose, at the bottom of the page, below the fold on a long worklist.
// The seam, through its one door: nothing above the seam names an implementation, so this file must
// never import `@/lib/data/supabase` or `@/lib/data/mock` (RULE-02).

          — the same five addresses in § 2b's order, the same `admin-hub-link` row id with the same
          `data-to`, and the same five `admin-hub-*-link` ids on the anchors — and `AdminLayout`
          renders it above this screen and above each of the five. **AC-3, AC-4, AC-5 and AC-9 all
          still pass on THIS page, unedited**, because the rows they count and follow are still on
          it; they are one element higher up the tree.

          **IT MUST NOT BE RENDERED TWICE.** A second copy of the five here would put two nodes
          under each `admin-hub-*-link`, which fails AC-9's exactly-one count and every strict-mode
          click in the eight other spec files that follow one. That is the whole reason this list is
          gone rather than kept alongside the strip, and it is why the five blurbs moved to the tab
          anchors' `title` instead of staying as a second, fuller list.
