// CAL-02 — edit one of the caller's own entries. 01-plan.md sections 2 and 4.3.
//
// EVERYTHING here is an affordance (ADR-005). `entry_update_own` is what decides whose entry may be
// edited (AC-9), the update grant's column list is what refuses `member_id`, `status` and
// `rejection_reason` (AC-8, AC-10), `entry_no_overlapping_portion` is INV-01 and AC-7, and
// `entry_enforce_decision()` is INV-02 and AC-5 and AC-6. This screen implements none of them; it
// shows what the datastore answered.
//
// **THE ENTRY IS LOADED FROM ONE LIST READ AND THERE IS NO `getEntryById`.** A single-row read would
// be a read whose only distinct behaviour is answering about rows the caller may not edit (CAL-02
// 01-plan.md section 4.3). It also makes `edit-entry-not-found` say nothing about whether the id
// exists: not in your list and no such entry are one answer here, as they are in the seam.
//
// **CAL-03 CHOOSES WHICH LIST BY THE CALLER'S ROLE, and that is the whole of this screen's change.**
// An admin loads `listTeamEntries()`, everybody else `listOwnEntries()`. THIS IS AN AFFORDANCE AND
// NOT A CONTROL: both reads are served by `entry_select_team`, which admits the team's rows to BOTH
// roles, so the branch decides which rows this screen OFFERS and decides nothing about which writes
// succeed. `entry_update_admin` is the control, and a member who reached an admin's list would still
// have every save refused (CAL-03 AC-5).
//
// **THE FORM ON THIS SCREEN STILL WRITES NO `status`, AND ADM-05 ADDS THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT THE
// FORM.** CAL-02's header read "nothing on this screen writes `status` … approving is ADM-05", and
// that is now here — as a SEPARATE panel beside the form, never as a field in it. `EntryForm`'s six
// substantive fields are untouched, and a decision is not an edit.
//
//   1. **`EntryDecision`, FOR AN ADMIN ONLY** — the affordance that makes AC-4, AC-5 and AC-11
//      reachable for an entry that is no longer pending. `/entries/pending` shows pending entries by
//      construction, so `rejected → approved` and the reason edit have nowhere else to happen. The
//      role branch this file already makes for its READ decides it, and it is an affordance for the
//      same reason that branch is: clause (a) of `public.entry_enforce_decision()` is the control,
//      and a member who reached the panel would have every decision refused (AC-8, AC-9).
//   2. **The rejection reason, and when the decision was recorded — FOR BOTH ROLES (AC-15).** The
//      member is the reader this criterion is about: v1 has no notification channel and must not
//      grow one, so the reason reaches its subject ON PULL, here, with no admin telling them. The
//      time is `updated_at`, which the trigger writes from the datastore's clock and no client can
//      set. WHO rejected is not available and 01-plan.md Open questions item 1 says why: `entry` has
//      no `rejected_by`, and clause (b) nulls `approved_by` on any transition off `approved` rather
//      than park a false record there.
//   3. **One sentence on what the star means (AC-19)**, beside `edit-entry-status`, which is where
//      somebody who has just seen a star on a calendar is standing.
