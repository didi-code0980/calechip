// CAL-10 — the year overview: four summary numbers above twelve month cards.
// 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6, inside ADR-032.
//
// **IT IS THE DEFAULT YEAR SCREEN AND THE MEMBER GRID IS NOT DELETED.** ADR-032 option 3: `/year`
// and `/year/:yyyy` render THIS, and CAL-06's 365-column per-member matrix moves, behaviourally
// unchanged, to `/year/:yyyy/members`. The question this screen answers is the one no surface in the
// product could answer before it — *what did this year look like* — where the matrix answers *who is
// away, and when*. Neither replaces the other, which is why both are routed (§ 1, Out of scope).
//
// **IT DERIVES NOTHING OF ITS OWN, AND THAT IS AC-12.** Every figure is a sum over `absenceCountsFor`
// or a lookup in one of the three maps beside it, all four from INV-04's ONE `walk` in
// @/lib/data/absence. No `.filter`, no comparison over an `Entry`, no arithmetic on a row appears
// below. The summary band's PTO/WFH pair is the case ADR-032 § Consequences item 4 warns about: it
// comes from `absenceByTypeFor`, which walks that same pass with those same weights, so
// `pto + wfh = total` is an IDENTITY a reader can check on screen rather than an assertion that can
// drift (AC-5, AC-6, § 4.1).
//
// **IT COMPUTES NO OVERLOAD STATE.** `seam.getTeam()` is deliberately not called, for the reason
// YearView.tsx:24-26 already records: it exists to supply `overloadThreshold`, and calling it is the
// first step toward a colour this screen has not designed. § 1 Out-of-scope refuses
// `--color-overload` here, so no soft pink appears.
//
// **NO VIETNAMESE COPY, AND NOTHING BELOW IS A TRANSLATION OF THE PICTURE.** The interface is English
// and the rule is lint-enforced as a build failure (eslint.config.js:80-92). The picture's
// `TỔNG ĐƠN PHÉP` is not translated at all — it names *total leave requests*, mixes units with the
// two cards under it, and `phép` is leave while a WFH day is not; § 2 replaces it with the year's
// absence total, the same quantity and unit as the two beneath (§ 2 Open questions 1). And no label
// here reads `remaining`, `left`, `balance`, `quota` or `allowance`: charter refusal 1 is brushed and
// not crossed, because counting what was declared is not a quota (AC-17).
//
// The layout is the image at .ai/board/tickets/CAL-10/design/year-overview-2026-09-08.jpg, spent in
// 01-plan.md § 2 and § 2b. It is evidence of intent and not a specification — what it decides became
// a criterion there, and the three arrangements it leaves ambiguous are marked as the Tech Lead's
// own in § 2b and are implemented here: the footer link is always at the RIGHT and the faces at the
// LEFT, faces overflow after FOUR, and the card link takes the same focus treatment every other link
// in the product carries.

/**
 * CAL-10 AC-3, second half — the member grid at `/year/:yyyy/members`, with the ONE behaviour the
 * move obliges: a malformed year resolves on the screen it was asked for.
 *
 * **THIS EXISTS BECAUSE `YearView.tsx` IS NOT IN THIS TICKET'S `allowed_paths` (RULE-03).** That
 * screen redirects a malformed anchor to `/year/<currentYear>` (:265), which was the member grid
 * before ADR-032 and is the OVERVIEW after it — so `/year/banana/members` would silently move the
 * caller between the two screens, which is exactly what AC-3's last clause forbids. § 4.2's three
 * route lines cannot express that, and editing `YearView` to express it is a write outside
 * `allowed_paths`. Wrapping it is the one remaining move, and it changes nothing about the grid:
 * `YearView` is rendered exactly as it is today, and reached with an anchor it already accepts.
 *
 * It is HERE and not in `src/App.tsx` so that file keeps the property four of its own route comments
 * state — *this file holds no clock* — and so the redirect stays in a component, which is the same
 * reason `/month`, `/week` and `/year` each resolve their own anchor rather than being resolved by a
 * route. 03-impl-log.md § Deviations records both.
