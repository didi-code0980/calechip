// CAL-06 — the year view: one row per member across every day of the year.
// 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.
//
// **IT IS THE ONLY SCREEN THAT ENUMERATES MEMBERS WITH NO ENTRIES.** The month grid draws avatars
// where somebody is away and the week lists rows where somebody is away; on both, a person who has
// declared nothing simply does not appear. Here every member of the roster gets a row whether or not
// they ever appear in it, which is the property AC-3 asserts and the reason
// .ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md carries `Read the member list` at all — 01-plan.md section 3
// records that this is the layout that row was derived from.
//
// **IT IS READ-ONLY, AND THE DENIAL IS HELD BY ABSENCE.** No approve, no reject, no edit, no delete,
// no draft panel, for either role. There is no policy to point at (an admin reaching
// `seam.updateEntry` from a console still succeeds, correctly, because CAL-03 granted it), so what
// this file guarantees is that no write reaches THIS surface — checked by reading the imports below
// and finding no write function and no control. 01-plan.md section 3 names that the weakest
// mechanism in the plan.
//
// **IT DERIVES NOTHING OF ITS OWN.** Which cells are filled comes from `absentDatesByMember` and the
// per-day totals come from `absenceCountsFor`, both derivations of INV-04's ONE pass in
// @/lib/data/absence. A `.filter(e => e.status !== ...)` written anywhere in this file would be the
// second definition INV-04 exists to forbid, and the divergence it names — a filled cell on a day
// whose total does not count it — is invisible on either half of this screen alone (AC-9, AC-10).
//
// **AND IT COMPUTES NO OVERLOAD STATE.** `seam.getTeam()` is deliberately not called (01-plan.md
// section 4.2): it exists to supply `overloadThreshold`, and calling it would be the first step
// toward a colour this ticket has not designed. No soft pink appears here.
//
// Colour, and where it comes from. `.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md` § Colour is still
// `TODO(project)`, so the palette is cited to `CLAUDE.md` § Visual direction, the only place in the
// repository that carries it: PTO peach, WFH mint, tentative at reduced opacity. Holidays are
// lavender, and CAL-08 draws them HERE — the sentence this replaces said they were not drawn on this
// screen, and that ticket is the one that spends it. It draws them in a NEW ONE-ROW STRIP under the
// month ruler and NOT in the member cells: tinting those would put a lookup on all 10,950 of them,
// which is the budget this file's own comments make load-bearing (CAL-08 01-plan.md § 2b and section
// 8, rejected alternative 5). A bridge day is a working day, gets no lavender, and is marked with a
// dot instead. 01-plan.md § 2b records that no image was attached at either stage and that the
// arrangement below is the Tech Lead's own; the prototype in _figma/ is not evidence for this row and
// was not read, cited or copied.
