// CAL-03 — the team's entries, and an admin's edit and delete controls over them.
// 01-plan.md sections 2, 3 and 4.3.
//
// EVERYTHING here is an affordance (ADR-005). The controls are in the database and nowhere else:
// `entry_update_admin` and `entry_delete_admin` are what decide whose entry an admin may write
// (AC-5, AC-8), the update grant's column list is what refuses `member_id` (AC-7),
// `entry_insert_own` is what refuses creating on somebody's behalf (AC-6),
// `entry_no_overlapping_portion` is INV-01 and AC-9, and `entry_enforce_decision()` is INV-02 and
// AC-3 and AC-4. This screen implements none of them.
//
// **THE REFUSAL BELOW IS AN AFFORDANCE AND NOT A CONTROL, and it is worth being explicit because a
// screen that says "this page is for admins" reads exactly like one.** What stops a member editing
// somebody else's entry is `entry_update_admin`; a member who types this address still reaches this
// component, and if the refusal were deleted they would see the list and every write would still be
// refused. `entry_select_team` admits the whole team's rows to BOTH roles — the read is not the
// capability. AC-10 asserts the affordance; AC-5 asserts the control, by issuing the write rather
// than by looking for a button. The same shape AllowList.tsx and MemberList.tsx already use, which
// is why neither of those files is in this ticket's `allowed_paths`.
//
// **NOTHING ON THIS SCREEN WRITES `status`.** Approving and rejecting are ADM-04 and ADM-05. The
// status is DISPLAYED because AC-3 and AC-4 turn on it — an admin's substantive edit returns an
// approved entry to pending and a note-only edit does not, and an admin who could not see that would
// be revoking a colleague's approval without being told.
//
// **AND NOTHING HERE RECORDS WHO EDITED.** `.ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md` known weakness 3 is
// made real by this screen and is not closed by it: `updated_at` moves and says WHEN, never WHO.
// `data-model.md` OPEN QUESTIONS item 5 offers `updated_by`, it is a schema change, and RULE-09
// makes it the operator's. 01-plan.md Open questions item 1 carries it.
