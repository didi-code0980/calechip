// ADM-04 — the worklist of entries awaiting a decision. 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.3 and 4.5.
//
// **ADM-05 PUTS THE DECISION ON THIS SURFACE, which is what ADM-04's own header said it would.**
// That header read "it carries no approve control and no reject control, and that is the ticket
// rather than an omission" — the losing half of a triage argument kept in
// .ai/registry/features.md:103 so nobody re-argued it there. It is spent now: ADM-05 mounts
// `EntryDecision` on each row, consuming `entry_update_admin` and clause (a) of
// `public.entry_enforce_decision()`. ADM-04's other three verbs are UNCHANGED — this screen still
// LISTS, FILTERS and COUNTS exactly as it did, and ADM-04's own suite passes unedited.
//
// **THE ONE WRITE IS THE PANEL'S AND THIS FILE STILL ISSUES NONE.** `EntryDecision` calls the seam;
// this screen hands it an entry and re-reads when it reports back. The link on a row still goes to
// `/entries/:id/edit`, which is CAL-02's and CAL-03's shipped screen.
//
// **ADM-06 ADDED THE BATCH TO THIS SURFACE AND SOLO REMOVED IT AGAIN ON 2026-09-10**, on the
// operator's instruction: *"Bỏ phần Select entries to reject them together."* `BulkRejection.tsx` is
// deleted, the selection state and the per-row checkbox with it, and `tests/e2e/adm-06-bulk-reject.spec.ts`
// is deleted because all five of its tests drove the removed controls.
//
// **THE SEAM AND THE DATABASE ARE UNTOUCHED, AND THE OPERATOR CHOSE THAT DEPTH WHEN ASKED.**
// `seam.rejectEntries`, `BulkRejectionOutcome`, `tests/bulk-rejection.test.ts` and
// `supabase/migrations/20260905230000_adm06_reject_entries.sql` all stay. So ADM-06's CAPABILITY is
// intact and only its surface is gone — re-mounting a bar later needs a component and nothing else,
// and no schema change was made on live data to undo something a UI decision can undo for free.
//
// **THE FILTERS AND THE PAGER ARE GONE TOO, FROM THE SAME INSTRUCTION**: *"Bỏ phần filter"* and
// *"Bỏ pagination thay bằng load more"*. What that costs ADM-04 is named at the query and at the
// list below. This screen now LISTS and COUNTS; it no longer FILTERS, and it pages by ACCUMULATING
// rather than by replacing.
//
// **AFTER A DECISION THE SCREEN RE-READS FROM THE FIRST PAGE (ADM-05 AC-1, AC-2).** `reload()`,
// never a local splice: the row leaves the queue and `pending-entries-count` falls because the
// datastore says so. Splicing would make the count and the list disagree, which is the one property
// this screen was built not to have.
//
// **A DECISION COLLAPSES AN EXPANDED LIST BACK TO ONE PAGE, AND THAT IS A CHOSEN COST.** The
// alternative — re-reading pages 0..k and concatenating — is k requests, and it is not even correct:
// these are OFFSET pages over a set that just shrank, so re-reading them after a removal can skip a
// row into the gap the decided entry left. One read from the top can skip nothing.
//
// **THE REFUSAL IS AN AFFORDANCE AND NOT A CONTROL**, and it has to be said plainly because a screen
// that says "this page is for admins" reads exactly like one — the sentence TeamEntries.tsx already
// carries, and here it is stronger. `entry_select_team` admits the whole team's rows to BOTH roles,
// so a member who deleted this refusal in a debugger would see a list of rows they can already read
// at `/entries/team`, and would gain nothing. There is no capability behind this screen that a
// member lacks, which is why nothing in this file is load-bearing for security (01-plan.md section
// 3).
//
// **THE COUNT AND THE LIST COME FROM ONE READ AND CANNOT DISAGREE.** `seam.listPendingEntries`
// returns the page AND the exact size of the matching set in one response. Two calls could disagree,
// because a write can land between them, and the feature row forbids exactly that. Nothing in this
// file derives the outstanding figure from `rows.length`.
//
// **`today` IS THIS MACHINE'S DATE AND IS PASSED INTO THE READ.** The one place a local date read is
// correct — the exception MonthView.tsx records for `currentMonth()` — because "what day is it for
// the person looking at the screen" is a fact about their clock. A server-side `current_date` would
// be evaluated in UTC and would move the boundary seven hours early for a Vietnamese team.
//
// Colour: `.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md` section Colour is still `TODO(project)`, and every
// criterion here turns on an attribute or on copy rather than on a colour, so none of them changes
// when the standard is written. 01-plan.md section 2b records that no image was attached at any
// stage and that the arrangement below is the Tech Lead's own — borrowed wholesale from
// TeamEntries.tsx, which is the nearest thing the product has to this screen.

      {/* SOLO, 2026-09-10 — **LOAD MORE, WHICH REPLACED THE PAGER**, on the operator's instruction:
          *"Bỏ pagination thay bằng load more"*. ADM-04 AC-4 is rewritten against this control and
          its argument is UNTOUCHED: this is still paging and not truncation, because a ceiling turns
          a long queue into an error and a queue long enough to trip it is precisely the queue an
          admin most needs to work through (01-plan.md § 8, rejected alternative 4). What changed is
          that the next page is APPENDED rather than swapped in, so working down a long queue never
          costs the admin their place.

          **ABSENT WHEN EVERY ROW IS ON SCREEN, NOT DISABLED.** The old pager rendered `Previous` and
          `Next` greyed out on a one-page set — visible controls asserting that more exists. A
          disabled control here would say the same untrue thing, and there is no state to advertise:
          the list is complete, and a screen that has nothing more to give should say nothing.
          `pending-entries-page` kept ITS name on the wrapper so the surrounding assertions about
          where the control lives did not all have to move; what it holds is a different control and
          the ids inside it are new.

          `data-shown` and `data-total` are on the header's count sentence, not here — this element
