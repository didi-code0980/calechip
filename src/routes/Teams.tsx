// SOLO, 2026-09-11 — the Teams tab: every team on the system, managed by any admin.
//
// **THE OPERATOR'S THREE DECISIONS, asked as explicit questions with the costs stated:** every admin
// manages every team (two roles, as the charter says — no third); only an EMPTY team may be deleted;
// an approved member may be moved between teams and their history follows them. The fourth — a tab
// of its own rather than a section of `/setting` — is why this is a new screen and not an edit of
// `Threshold.tsx`, which is one team's settings.
//
// **NOTHING HERE IS THE CONTROL (ADR-005).** Every write is one of the `security definer` functions
// in `supabase/migrations/20260911180000_solo_many_teams.sql`, and each begins by testing
// `is_admin` in its own body. A member who reached this screen in a debugger reads nothing —
// `list_teams()` and `list_all_members()` answer an empty set — and any write they issued by hand is
// refused by the function, not by anything in `src/`.
//
// **EVERY WRITE RE-READS, AND NOTHING IS SPLICED LOCALLY.** A move changes two teams' counts and can
// change which team is the caller's own; a delete removes a row; a create adds one. Predicting any of
// those here would be a second copy of the datastore's answer, free to disagree with it — the rule
// `NewSignups.tsx` states for its queue.
//
// **THE SIDEBAR ROSTER DOES NOT FOLLOW A MOVE UNTIL THE NEXT DOCUMENT LOAD**, the same limit
// `tests/e2e/solo-new-signups.spec.ts` records for an approval: `useRoster` reads once on mount and
// the sidebar never unmounts. Recorded rather than fixed — a roster that re-reads on a write is a
// different change.
