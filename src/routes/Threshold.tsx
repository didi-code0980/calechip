// ADM-01 — set the overload threshold. 01-plan.md sections 3, 4.1 and 4.3.
//
// **SOLO, 2026-09-11 — THIS SCREEN IS NOW THE TEAM'S SETTINGS AND THE THRESHOLD IS ONE OF THEM.**
// The operator asked for *"nơi quản lí list Teams ở admin"* and chose, when shown the three shapes,
// the single-team one: name, member count, created date and threshold on one screen.
//
// **IT EXTENDS THIS SCREEN RATHER THAN ADDING `/team`, AND THE ADDRESS NO LONGER MATCHES THE
// CONTENT.** That mismatch is the accepted cost and it is the smaller one. This file is the only
// screen in the product that writes `public.team`, so putting the name here keeps ONE editor for
// each column; a separate `/team` screen would either duplicate the threshold control or leave two
// admin tabs talking about one team. Re-addressing is what UIE-09's plan refused in terms — *"it
// re-addresses four shipped screens, changes every `page.goto` in their refusal tests, changes each
// screen's own back link"* — and six specs point at `/threshold` today. The TAB is renamed to
// `Team`, which is what an admin reads; no spec asserts a tab's name.
//
// **SOLO, 2026-09-11, LATER THE SAME DAY — THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS SUPERSEDED BY THE OPERATOR.** Asked
// where the approval switches should live, they chose to re-address this screen to `/setting` and name
// the tab `Settings`, knowingly paying the cost that paragraph declined: every `page.goto` in the
// refusal tests moved with it. `/threshold` redirects here so an old link still lands. The file keeps
// its name and every `threshold-*` id keeps its spelling — the threshold control still exists on this
// screen, and seventy-odd assertions address those ids rather than the path.
//
// **EVERY `threshold-*` ID IS UNCHANGED, and that is what keeps ADM-01's eleven criteria passing
// unedited.** The threshold block below is the one this file shipped, moved under an `<h2>` and
// otherwise untouched. The name block is new and every id in it begins `team-`.
//
// EVERYTHING in this file is an affordance (ADR-005). The check lives in row-level security and
// nowhere else: `team_update_admin` plus `grant update (overload_threshold) on public.team` refuse a
// member, a removed member, another team and every column other than the one, whoever issues the
// statement. What is below hides a control the policy would refuse anyway, which saves a round trip
// and says why — it enforces nothing. AC-5 is the criterion that proves it: it calls the seam
// function past every control this file draws.
//
// THE SCREEN IS THE ONE EDGE THAT SPEAKS PERCENT. `Team.overloadThreshold` is a SHARE and the seam
// declares the fraction form on `SetOverloadThresholdInput`; `src/lib/data/absence.ts` compares a
// share on both sides. The two conversions below are the only ones in the product, and putting them
// in `src/lib/` would create a second place that knows the representation (01-plan.md section 5).

              A native constraint does not merely add a second check — it SUPPRESSES the submit

              and AC-8's "the screen says…" is satisfied by a browser tooltip that names no
              percentage and that no selector in design section 4.3 can reach. Measured: with
              `min`/`max`/`step` present, both criteria failed on that selector being absent.

      {/* SOLO, 2026-09-11 — the operator's `WFH_NEED_APPROVE` and `PTO_NEED_APPROVE`.

          **A CHECKED BOX MEANS "NEEDS APPROVAL"**, which is the operator's own polarity — the flag is
          named for the requirement, and a switch labelled the opposite way from the thing it stores
          is how an admin turns approval off while meaning to turn it on. Both start checked: that is
          the columns' default and what the product did before this block existed.

          **THE THIRD SENTENCE BELOW IS TRUE TODAY AND IS MEANT TO CHANGE.** The operator chose that an
          edited entry of a no-approval type be re-approved automatically. That is against INV-02's
          text and waits for an ADR; until it lands the datastore sends an edited approved entry back
          to `pending`, and a screen that promised otherwise would be describing a product that does
          not exist. When the ADR lands, this sentence is the one to delete.

          THE ENFORCEMENT IS THE DATASTORE'S, as everywhere on this screen: `team_update_admin` and the
          column grant refuse a member's write, and `entry_apply_approval_setting()` makes the
          approval. This form moves two switches and decides nothing. */}
