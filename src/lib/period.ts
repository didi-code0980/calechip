// UIE-02 — the period vocabulary the top bar needs, and the one structural move in this ticket.
// 01-plan.md § 4.5 is the contract this file implements.
//
// **NOTHING HERE IS NEW BEHAVIOUR. Every function below already existed, module-private, in one or
// two of the three period screens**, and the top bar needs all of them. `shiftMonth` came from
// MonthView.tsx, `shiftYear` from YearView.tsx, and `mondayIndex` was DUPLICATED character for
// character in WeekView.tsx and MonthView.tsx. Moving each definition here deletes a copy rather
// than creating a third one — which is why this file's arrival edits the three screens, and why
// those three edits are import swaps that change no rendered output (01-plan.md § 7).
//
// **PURE, AND IT IMPORTS NOTHING FROM `src/lib/data/`.** 01-plan.md § 5 requires that in as many
// words. It is string arithmetic over `yyyy-MM-dd`, `yyyy-MM` and `yyyy`; it fetches nothing, names
// no column and holds no clock. RULE-02 therefore holds here by construction rather than by
// inspection — there is no import for eslint.config.js:60-79 to fire on.
//
// **IT HOLDS EXACTLY ONE CLOCK, AND ONLY FOR `/`.** Amended at PLAN rework 1. The superseded
// sentence read *it holds no clock, and that is the point of `todayTo`* — true while `/` redirected,
// false once AC-5 made `/` show the current week IN PLACE. There is no later address to wait for
// there, so `currentDay()` moved here from `WeekView.tsx` and `periodNavFor("/")` uses it.
//
// `MonthView.tsx`'s `currentMonth()` and `YearView.tsx`'s `currentYear()` are still NOT folded in
// (01-plan.md § 8, rejected alternative 4 and its amendment): `/month` and `/year` are redirected by
// their own screens within a render, so the top bar still never needs to know what month or year it
// is, and each of those functions carries the argument for why a LOCAL read is correct on the screen
// it is about.
