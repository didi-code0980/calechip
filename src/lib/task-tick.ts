// TSK-05 — the optimistic tick. 01-plan.md § 4.1.
//
// **THE SCREEN SHOWS A PRESS BEFORE THE DATABASE HAS ACCEPTED IT, AND THE DATABASE STILL DECIDES.**
// A press flips what `shown` returns at once; the write runs behind it, and a refusal puts the value
// back (AC-3). What is shown is an affordance and nothing else — the policies on `public.task` are
// the control (§ 3).
//
// **ONE WRITE IN FLIGHT PER TASK** (AC-4, § 8 alternative 1). Two concurrent updates of one row reach
// PostgreSQL in no promised order, so a press made while a write is outstanding only changes the value
// wanted; when the write answers, the value wanted is sent if the server does not already hold it.
// The database therefore applies the presses in the order they were made, and stores the last.
//
// Pure: no React, no seam import, no clock, no timer. The page passes the write in (RULE-02).
