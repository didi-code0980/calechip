// CAL-12 — which team the calendar screens and the sidebar roster draw. 01-plan.md § 4.1.
//
// **PURE LOGIC AND ONE READ SWITCH, AND NOTHING ELSE.** No React, no router, no seam instance: the
// seam arrives as an argument, so `tests/viewed-team.test.ts` hands it the mock (or a stub that
// throws) and proves the switch without a browser. This file imports the `DataSeam` TYPE only —
// RULE-02 is about who reaches the datastore, and a type reaches nothing.
//
// **`teamReadsFor` IS THE ONLY PLACE THE OWN/OTHER BRANCH IS WRITTEN.** 01-plan.md § 8, rejected
// alternative 2: five copies of the switch, one in each screen and the roster, and a single missed
// branch draws team A's rows under team B's notice — an INV-07 violation that looks correct. Here it
// is written once, and an `other` read never calls an own-team method, so a failure cannot fall back
// to the caller's own team (AC-12).
//
// **NO COUNT IS COMPUTED HERE (INV-04).** `roster()` returns the FULL roster, removed members
// included, because `absenceCountsFor` needs them; the sidebar's removed-member filter is display
// only and lives in `useRoster`.
