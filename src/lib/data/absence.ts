// It is in src/lib/data/ because .ai/registry/features.md:91 puts it there by name: "a pure function
// in one shared module inside `src/lib/data/`, imported by both seam implementations and
// reimplemented in neither". 01-plan.md section 8 records the disagreement — this is a domain
// computation and src/lib/domain/ is arguably its home — and resolves it in the registry's favour,
// because RULE-04 makes the registry row the source. Moving it costs one `git mv` and one import.
//
// **NEITHER SEAM IMPLEMENTATION CALLS IT, AND THAT IS THE DECISION (01-plan.md section 5).** The
// registry's fear is two arithmetics that tests/seam-parity.test.ts cannot see: same names, same
// arity, different maths. With zero copies inside the seam there is nothing for the parity test to
// miss — mock.ts and supabase.ts return ROWS and count nothing, and the month view imports this
// module directly.
//
// **IT FETCHES NOTHING.** Every input is passed in. That is what makes it usable by CAL-07, which
// must compute the count a day WILL have if the draft in the form is saved — an unsaved entry has no
// row, so a datastore-side aggregate could not be the only implementation and INV-04 would need a
// second one in TypeScript. That is the whole reason a PostgreSQL view was rejected (section 8).
//
// This file imports nothing from ./index and nothing from either implementation. It may be imported
// from any layer; it names no column and constructs no client.
