// SOLO, 2026-09-10 — the calendar the entry form chooses days on, in place of two date inputs.
//
// The operator's design replaces `From` and `To` with a month grid: click a day and it fills, click
// it again and it empties, and the days chosen need not be next to each other. The mock shows the
// 1st filled on its own beside a run of the 8th to the 12th, which is the whole reason this control
// hands its caller a SET of days rather than a pair — `dateRuns` in @/lib/date-selection is what
// turns that set back into the ranges the datastore stores.
//
// **IT HOLDS NO SELECTION AND NO RULE.** The chosen days are the caller's state, the toggle is
// `toggleDate`, and the only thing this component owns is WHICH MONTH is on screen. A picker that
// held the selection would be a second place the form's values live.
//
// **IT REFUSES NOTHING** (charter refusal 6). Every cell is clickable, including the days of the
// neighbouring months that complete the first and last week, and including days in the past — that
// last one is `TODO(project)` on .ai/registry/features.md:87 and CAL-01 AC-12, and the two date
// inputs this control replaces carried no `min` for exactly that reason. Adding one here would
// answer an open question with a widget.
//
// Colour is `CLAUDE.md` § Visual direction through the tokens UIE-01 and UIE-06 declared: a chosen
// PTO day is `--color-pto` (peach), a chosen WFH day `--color-wfh` (mint), and the grid sits on
// `--color-bg`. Nothing here invents a hex.
