// SOLO, 2026-09-26 — the floating control a person reports an issue with.
//
// **THE OPERATOR ASKED FOR A BUBBLE**: *"float button. như bubbles chat. hiện ở mọi trang"*. So it is
// `position: fixed` in the bottom-right corner, not a row in the sidebar and not a face in the top
// bar — both of which were offered and neither of which was chosen.
//
// **"EVERY PAGE" MEANS EVERY PAGE INSIDE THE SHELL, AND THAT IS WHERE IT IS MOUNTED.** `AppShell` is
// rendered by `src/App.tsx` only for `membership.state === "member"`, so this reaches an approved
// member on a team and nobody else: `/signin`, `/signup`, the awaiting-approval notice and the
// not-on-a-team notice are all outside it. That matches the table — `issue_report.member_id` is
// `not null` and `issue_report_insert_own` compares it with `auth.uid()`, so a report needs an
// author and a signed-out person has none.
//
// **IT IS NOT A CONTROL IN THE ADR-005 SENSE AND NOTHING HERE PRETENDS OTHERWISE.** The control is
// `issue_report_insert_own` plus the insert grant's column list, both in the database. A person who
// reached this component with a debugger and sent somebody else's `member_id` is refused by the
// policy and by nothing in `src/`.

          button rather than under it. Bottom-RIGHT, which is the corner no screen in this product
          puts a control in.

          SOLO, 2026-09-26 (second run) — **THE BUTTON AND ITS TOOLTIP ARE ONE POSITIONED GROUP.**
          One `fixed` wrapper holding both, laid out as a row, so the tooltip sits to the LEFT of the
          button and moves with it. Two independently fixed elements would have to agree about a
          corner by arithmetic, and they would stop agreeing the first time the button's size
          changed.

          `group` is on the WRAPPER and not on the button, because the tooltip is the button's
          SIBLING and `group-hover` reads the nearest ancestor marked `group`, never a sibling.
          Hovering the wrapper is hovering the button: the tooltip is `pointer-events-none` and the
          wrapper is exactly the two of them. */}

            is the honest verdict on `title`: a one-second delay, an unstyleable box, no touch
            support, and nothing at all when the control is reached by keyboard. This one appears on
            hover AND on focus, so a keyboard user gets the same sentence a mouse user does.

            `group-hover` / `group-focus-within` rather than React state: there is nothing to
            remember between renders, and a tooltip driven by state re-renders the form beside it on
            every pointer move. `pointer-events-none` so the tooltip can never eat the click that was
            aimed at the button behind it.

            IT IS `aria-hidden` AND THE BUTTON KEEPS ITS `aria-label`. A screen reader announces the
            label; the tooltip is the same words drawn for people who can see them, and announcing
