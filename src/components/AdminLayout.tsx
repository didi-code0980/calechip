// SOLO, 2026-09-09 — the admin area's layout route element.
//
// **IT IS A LAYOUT ROUTE'S `element`, NOT A WRAPPER AND NOT A `useLocation()` CONDITIONAL**, which
// is the same choice `AppShell.tsx` records in its own header and for the same reason: a component
// that decides *am I on an admin screen* by reading the pathname is the route table re-expressed as
// an if-statement, in a file that already uses the router for exactly this distinction. That
// condition then has to be extended by hand every time an admin screen is added, and the failure is
// SILENT — a new admin address simply appears without the strip. Here the router decides, and adding
// the sixth admin screen means putting its `<Route>` inside one of the blocks in `App.tsx`.
//
// **THE STRIP IS DRAWN ONLY FOR AN ADMIN, AND THAT IS NOT A CONTROL.** Drawn for everybody it would
// hand a member a list of the five administrative addresses on every screen that refuses them —
// which is precisely what UIE-10 AC-1 removed from the sidebar, for both roles, four days ago. The
// destinations refuse a member either way (`allow-list-refused`, `team-entries-refused`,
// `threshold-refused`, `pending-entries-refused`, `member-list-not-on-a-team`); hiding the strip
// saves a pointless journey and refuses nobody, which is UIE-02's sentence about the same property.
//
// **`isAdmin` IS A BOOLEAN AND NOT THE `Member`**, the fourth alternative UIE-09 § 8 rejected: the
// one question this component has is *may this person administer*, a boolean answers it, and a
// `Member` prop invites the layout to grow a second reason to hold a member row. `App.tsx` computes
// the expression in the file that already holds the row, exactly as it does for `TopBar`.
//
// **(Superseded 2026-09-26.) THIS COMPONENT MAKES NO SEAM CALL AND HAS NO STATE.** It re-reads
// nothing, so it adds no phase to any screen below it. Each of the six destinations keeps its own
// loading, refusal and failure states untouched — including `/admin` itself, whose four phases
// `AdminHub.tsx` still owns.
//
// **SOLO, 2026-09-26 (second run) — IT NOW MAKES EXACTLY ONE SEAM CALL, AND THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS
// KEPT AS THE RECORD OF WHAT IT COST TO GIVE UP.** The operator asked for the number of reports not
// yet done to appear on the navigation tab. That number has to be read somewhere, and every other
// candidate is worse:
//   * `AdminTabs` reading it would put a seam call, a loading state and a failure path on a
//     presentational component whose whole documented value is having none — the fence UIE-09
//     `01-plan.md` § 1 put up, which still stands;
//   * `IssueReports.tsx` reading it cannot work, because the badge has to be right on the seven
//     admin screens that are NOT `/reports`;
//   * `App.tsx` reading it would put an admin-only read above the router, on every page in the
//     product including the calendar, for a number only the admin strip draws.
// So it is here: the one component that exists exactly where the strip does and nowhere else.
//
// **WHAT THIS DOES NOT COST.** It adds no phase to any screen below: each count starts `null`, the
// strip draws no badge for `null`, and the outlet renders immediately either way. A failed read
// leaves that one `null` for ever, which draws nothing — a badge is the one thing whose absence is a
// safe answer, and both count functions throw rather than returning a confident `0`.
//
// **SOLO, 2026-09-26 (third run) — IT NOW MAKES TWO, on the operator's instruction to put the same
// number on the `New sign-ups` tab.** The argument above is unchanged by the second one and would be
// unchanged by a third: the reads belong wherever the strip is, the strip is here, and each badge
// fails on its own rather than as a pair.
