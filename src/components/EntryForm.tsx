// CAL-02 — the six entry fields, their validation and their selectors, EXTRACTED from
// NewEntry.tsx rather than written a second time. 01-plan.md section 4.3.
//
// The extraction is the point: two forms would be two places where "an empty note is null" and "the
// submit button is disabled until the days are chosen" are decided, and the two would agree until
// somebody changed one.
//
// EVERYTHING here is an affordance (ADR-005). The controls are in the database: the insert and
// update policies' `with check (member_id = auth.uid())`, the two column grants' lists, and
// `entry_no_overlapping_portion`. This form refuses nobody holding a token; it saves a round trip
// and says why.
//
// **THERE IS NO MEMBER PICKER AND NO STATUS CONTROL, and both absences are load-bearing.** The
// first is the affordance for CAL-01 AC-10 and CAL-02 AC-8 (INV-07); the second for CAL-01 AC-11 and
// CAL-02 AC-10 — `status`, `rejection_reason`, `approved_by` and `approved_at` are absent from both
// grants, so no control here could carry one. Adding either would offer a journey that always ends
// in a refusal.
//
// Dates in the past are DELIBERATELY UNCONSTRAINED in either direction, on both routes. It is a
// `TODO(project)` on .ai/registry/features.md:87 and CAL-02 01-plan.md Open questions item 1, and it
// names editing explicitly: whether a member may move an entry onto a past date is the operator's
// decision. So the picker greys out nothing and neither seam function carries a past-date check.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SOLO, 2026-09-10 — THE FORM IS REDRAWN TO THE OPERATOR'S DESIGN, AND THE TWO DATE INPUTS ARE
// GONE. `/solo` with an image attached: no story, no review, no gate.
//
// The authority is `.claude/commands/solo.md` and `.claude/agents/solo.md`. Those two cite
// `.ai/registry/decisions/ADR-033-solo-engineer.md`, **which is not on disk** — ADR-033 in this
// repository is `a-person-joins-by-signing-up-and-an-admin-decides-afterwards`, so the number is
// taken and the solo exception has no ADR. `src/components/Sidebar.tsx:43` recorded the same
// discrepancy before this run; it is repeated rather than resolved, because writing that ADR is
// `.ai/registry/**` and RULE-01 makes it the operator's.
//
// Four changes, and the first is the one with consequences:
//
//   1. **`From` and `To` became a month grid** (`DayPicker`), so the form now holds a SET of days.
//      `EntryFormValues.dates` replaces `startDate` and `endDate`, and `dateRuns` gathers the set
//      into unbroken runs on the way out — **one entry per run**, which is how a datastore that
//      stores `start_date`/`end_date` receives a selection with gaps in it. CAL-01 AC-2 is unchanged
//      and is the reason it is runs and not one row per day: a contiguous week is ONE entry. The
//      design's own mock shows a gapped selection, so the gap is the specification.
//   2. **Type and portion became segmented controls** rather than `<select>`s. INV-06 is untouched:
//      still ONE portion for the whole selection, still no per-date control.
//   3. **The overload warning moved up, to sit directly under the grid**, where the design puts it
//      and where the days it is about are. It is drawn ONCE PER RUN — passing the outer bounds of a
//      gapped selection would count the days in the gap and warn about a day nobody chose.
//   4. **`onCancel` is new and optional.** The create routes draw the dialog's `Cancel`; the edit
//      route passes nothing and the control is absent, because a route has its own way back.
//
// **WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: this form still refuses nothing, still writes no `status`, and still
// carries no member picker.** The submit control keeps its `disabled` on an incomplete form, which
// is the same condition it always had, restated over days instead of over two inputs.
//
// **AN INVERTED RANGE IS NOW UNREACHABLE THROUGH THE INTERFACE** — a set of days has no order to
// invert. CAL-01 AC-9's refusal still exists in the seam and is still returned and rendered; what is
// gone is the control that could express the mistake. The spec that drove it through the two inputs
// is amended rather than deleted, and says so.
