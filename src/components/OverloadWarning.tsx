// CAL-07 — the warning a person sees while choosing dates, before anything is saved.
// 01-plan.md sections 4.2 and 4.3.
//
// **IT IS AN AFFORDANCE AND IT REFUSES NOTHING** (charter refusal 6, and AC-9 to AC-15). It renders
// a block or it renders null; it holds no submit state, disables no control, sets no field invalid
// and adds no required field. The save control lives in EntryForm and this component cannot reach
// it — which is how AC-9, AC-10 and AC-12 are held by construction rather than by a test.
//
// **IT COMPUTES NO COUNT OF ITS OWN.** Every number here comes from `absenceCountsFor` and
// `isOverloaded` in @/lib/data/absence, INV-04's single implementation, which this ticket does not
// touch. The only new step is `withDraft`, which builds the ROWS — 01-plan.md section 4.2.
//
// **RECOMPUTING IS NOT REFETCHING.** The fetched rows are held and the count is derived from them
// synchronously on every draft change, so changing the portion or the tentative flag updates the
// warning with no request at all (AC-4, AC-8) and only a change of start or end date reaches the
// datastore.
//
// Colour, and where it comes from. `.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md` is a stub in its Colour, Type
// and Components sections, so the palette is cited to CLAUDE.md section Visual direction through the
// component that already implements it: `bg-rose-100` is the exact class
// src/routes/MonthView.tsx:381 gives a crowded cell, and the per-person markers are
// src/routes/MonthView.tsx:410-427. 01-plan.md Open question 2 records that this is REUSE rather
// than a warning-specific vocabulary, which is what the CAL-07 registry row required of any answer.
