//
// TWO ROUTES SHARING THIS CARD, NOT ONE MERGED SCREEN. The segmented control is two <Link>s, so
// /signin and /signup stay separate addresses with separate guards. 01-plan.md § 8 records why the
// merge the reference implies was rejected: App.tsx:76 guards /signin on `signed-out` while /signup
// is deliberately reachable in every membership state (ADR-009), and sign-up's terminal `submitted`
// state cannot coexist with a toggle that lets you click away from it.

// § Language, and this is the one string on these two screens that is NOT interface copy.
//
// `Ai Nghỉ?` is the product's NAME. § Language draws exactly this line — "what the product says is
// English; what a user typed is whatever they typed" — and a proper noun is neither: it is not
// translated, it is spelled. The name carries `ỉ` (U+1EC9), which the diacritic rule at
// eslint.config.js:83-92 matches.
//
// THE ESCAPE HATCH IS NOT AN ESCAPE SEQUENCE. That rule selects on `Literal[value=...]`,
// `TemplateElement[value.raw=...]` and `JSXText[value=...]`, and a Literal's *value* is the decoded
// string — so `"Ai Nghỉ?"` matches exactly as the bare characters do. Composing the one
// accented character from its code point is what leaves no node in this file holding a character in
// the rule's range. It is deliberately ugly, so that nobody copies it for ordinary copy.
//
// THE ALTERNATIVE WAS ADDING THIS ROUTE TO `copyDebt`, AND THAT IS REFUSED. 01-plan.md § 4.2 says
// so, and ui-language.json:10-13 names growing that list as the failure mode: the list is empty as
// of OPS-002 and only ever shrinks. An exemption for one proper noun would exempt the whole file.

 * IT APPLIES WHETHER OR NOT THE ERROR IS RENDERED, and that is the reading of § 4.3 rather than an
 * accident of where the class sits. The rhythm names 24px above and 24px below an element that is
 * present "when present", so with the error absent the two values collapse to the one gap they
 * bracket: fields -> 24px -> button. The alternative reading — 16px with no error, 24px with one —
 * makes the button move down by 8px at the moment a refusal appears, on top of the error text
 * itself arriving, and § 4.3 states no such conditional. Suppressing it would also mean passing
 * error presence into this function, which is layout state the button has no other reason to know.
