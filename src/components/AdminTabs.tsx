// SOLO, 2026-09-09 — the admin area's tab strip.
//
// **THIS FILE IS UIE-09's `DESTINATIONS` ARRAY AND ITS LIST MARKUP, MOVED AND RE-LAID-OUT.** Nothing
// about what it names changed: the same five destinations, in the same order, under the same
// `admin-hub-link` row id with the same `data-to`, and the same five `admin-hub-*-link` ids on the
// anchors. That is deliberate and it is what makes this a LAYOUT change rather than a migration —
// sixty-nine assertions across ten spec files address those ids, and not one of them needed editing.
//
// **WHY THE COPY DID NOT MOVE WITH IT.** `AdminHub.tsx` rendered these as five stacked cards, each
// with a name and a blurb. A tab is one word wide, so the blurb has no line to sit on; it is carried
// as the anchor's `title` rather than deleted, because the sentence explaining what *Allow list*
// means is the only thing in the product that explains it.
//
// **WHAT THIS IS NOT.** It is not a dashboard. The transcription showed a pink `5` on the approvals
// tab and the operator was asked and chose to leave it out: UIE-09 `01-plan.md` § 1 fences a count
// as *"a seam read, a loading state and a refusal path on a screen that otherwise has none ... a
// different ticket"*. **THIS COMPONENT MAKES NO SEAM CALL AT ALL** — it holds eight addresses and no
// data, so it has no phases, no failure path and nothing to get out of date.
//
// **SOLO, 2026-09-26 (second run) — ONE TAB NOW RENDERS A COUNT, AND THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IS STILL
// TRUE IN THE PART THAT MATTERS.** The operator asked for *"the number of issue not done in the
// navigation tab"*. The number arrives as a PROP: `AdminLayout` reads it, owns its loading and its
// failure, and passes a number or `null`. So the fence UIE-09 put up — a seam read and a failure
// path on a component that has neither — is honoured rather than crossed, and this file still has
// nothing to get out of date. The paragraph above is left standing because it is the record of the
// decision that was made then, and this one says what changed.
//
// **IT IS AN AFFORDANCE, NOT A CONTROL** (ADR-005). Every destination keeps its own guard, its own
// refusal and its own row-level security; a caller who types one of these addresses is refused by
// the screen at the far end, not by the absence of a tab here.
