/**
 * UIE-02 § 4.6 and § 4.7 — the non-member arm of the shell layout route, and the home of the `p-8`
 * that `app-root` gave up.
 *
 * It is the centred, padded container that shipped before this ticket, unchanged in effect: a
 * signed-out or member-less caller sees exactly the screen they see today, in exactly the same
 * gutter, with no chrome (AC-2). `AuthCard.tsx:54` names that gutter as what satisfies UIE-01's
 * AC-16, so it had to land somewhere and this is where.
 *
 * USED IN TWO PLACES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS REVIEW REWORK 1. `/signin` and `/signup` stay outside
 * the SHELL layout route (§ 4.6, `ticket.yaml` § 3) — but "outside the shell" is not "outside every
 * container", and the first cycle read it as though it were: the two auth routes sat directly under
 * <Routes>, so the `p-8` that moved here never reached them and `AuthCard`'s own root carries no
 * padding (`AuthCard.tsx:60`). Measured at 360px the card had 2.5px either side and at 320px none,
 * where `app-root`'s `p-8` gave 32px before this ticket — UIE-01 AC-16 requires a gutter on both
 * sides, and the comment on `app-root` below says out loud that breaking it is what must not happen.
 *
 * The fix is a second `<Route element={<BareLayout />}>` parent over just those two routes. They are
 * still not children of the shell layout route, they still get no sidebar and no top bar, and no
 * membership condition is evaluated for them — the only thing they gain is the gutter § 4.7 says
 * they must have.

          It is a warning that the whole application is running on a fake datastore: inside the
          content pane it would be a property of the screen rather than of the build, and it would
          scroll away.

          THE `p-8` IT GAVE UP MOVES TO `BareLayout`, and that is not tidying. AuthCard.tsx:54
          names this element's `p-8` as the gutter that satisfies UIE-01's AC-16, so a shell that

                own elements or guards changed.

                NOT A WRAPPER AROUND <Routes>. 01-plan.md § 8, rejected alternative 1: a wrapper
                paints the sidebar on /signin and /signup too, and the only escape is a
                useLocation() conditional inside the shell — this route table re-expressed as an
                if-statement, in a file that already uses the router for exactly this distinction
                six times over. The condition would then have to be extended by hand every time a
                route is added, and the failure is SILENT: a new auth-adjacent route simply appears
                with a sidebar. The layout route puts the decision where the router enforces it.

                THE NON-MEMBER ARM IS A BARE LAYOUT AND NOT A REDIRECT, AND THAT IS THE TRAP THIS

                delete the reason each one records. `BareLayout` is the container those screens
                render in today, so a member-less caller reaches exactly the screen they reach now.

                  and TEA-05's AC-4, AC-5 and AC-9 are unchanged for the two with no member row.
                  What changed is the member's arm: `src/routes/Home.tsx` does not survive this
                  ticket (the feature row says so) and its twelve `home-*` ids are now in the shell,
                  so a member arriving at `/` sees THE CURRENT WEEK, IN PLACE. Week is the active
                  segment in the transcription.

                  IN PLACE, AND NOT A REDIRECT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF PLAN REWORK 1. A redirect
                  makes `/` an address the application never rests on, and five shipped spec files
                  walk browser history back to it in helpers — a `page.goto` there would reset the
                  mock seam's module state and lose entries an earlier step created. Twenty-five
                  acceptance tests measured the difference.

                  AND NOT A REDIRECT WITHOUT `replace` EITHER, which is the other way to keep `/` in
                  history: arriving at `/` by popstate would fire the redirect again and forward the
                  caller onward for ever, which is the Back-button trap AC-23's second clause names.

                  `NotOnATeam` renders inside `BareLayout`, because this layout's ELEMENT is chosen

{/* **SOLO, 2026-09-09 — THE ADMIN TAB STRIP, AND WHY THERE ARE THREE OF THESE BLOCKS
                  RATHER THAN ONE.** `AdminLayout` draws `AdminTabs` above whatever the child route
                  renders, so the ROUTER decides which screens carry the strip — the same shape
                  `BareLayout` and `AppShell` above already use, and not a `useLocation()` test
                  inside a component (`AdminLayout.tsx` records why at length).

                  The six admin addresses fall into three ADJACENT PAIRS in this table, and they are
                  wrapped where they lie instead of being gathered into one block. Gathering them
                  would move six route blocks and roughly a hundred and thirty lines of the reasoning
                  attached to them, and it would reorder a table whose order carries a documented
                  argument — `/entries/pending` sits above `/entries/:id/edit` and the comment there
                  explains why. Three two-line wrappers cost less than that and change no matching:
                  none of the six paths is a prefix of another, and the `*` catch-all stays last.

                  `isAdmin` AND NOT THE `Member`: the layout's one question is whether to draw the
                  strip, and a member must not be handed a list of the five administrative addresses
                  on every screen that refuses them — UIE-10 AC-1 removed exactly that from the

                    `TODO(project):` was answered at its own PLAN with *its own screen at /threshold*,
                    and .ai/registry/features.md:103 says the later admin rows inherit that answer rather
                    than re-asking it. `/entries/pending` sits in the family `/entries/team` and
                    `/entries/new` already established.

                    A STATIC SEGMENT ABOVE `/entries/:id/edit`, and it cannot be shadowed by it: react
                    router v7 ranks a static segment above a dynamic one regardless of declaration order,
                    so `/entries/pending` never resolves to EditEntry with an id of "pending".

                    GUARDED ON `member` AND NOT ON `admin`, which is the choice /entries/team and
                    /threshold already record: a member who types this address must reach the component
                    and be refused BY IT (`pending-entries-refused`, AC-10) rather than be bounced to
                    `/`, because the refusal is what says why. The guard is an affordance either way —
                    and here there is no control behind it at all: `entry_select_team` admits these rows
                    to both roles, so a member who got past the refusal would see what they can already
                    read at /entries/team (01-plan.md section 3). */}

                    IT ADDS A ROUTE ABOVE THE FOUR AND MOVES NONE OF THEM. `/threshold` is still

                  to the current year, and so does a malformed one, and the component does that rather
                  than a second route here — "which year is it" is a fact about the caller's clock and
                  this file holds no clock (AC-9).

                  GUARDED ON A SESSION AND NOT ON A ROLE, which is unlike every guard above it. Both
                  signed-in states render: `holiday_select_all` is `using (true)` and a holiday belongs
                  to no team, so a caller with no member row reads the calendar exactly as a member
                  does (AC-7) — there is no "you are not on a team" to say about a national calendar,
                  and no role to check either, because `Read the holiday calendar` is checked for both
                  roles in .ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md (AC-1, AC-2).

                  A SIGNED-OUT CALLER GOES TO `/`, which resolves by membership to the sign-in screen.
                  That guard exists for one specific reason rather than for symmetry: with no session
                  the read returns nothing, and an unguarded screen would then render AC-10's
                  past-the-horizon notice and tell a stranger the calendar is short (AC-6). It is an
