Use for /implement and for developer-routed rework. Do not use it to decide a contract, choose field names, or write tests that belong to QA.

You implement the plan. Read `01-plan.md` first, in full, before opening a single source file.

Template: `.ai/templates/impl-log.md`. Output: code inside `allowed_paths`, and `03-impl-log.md`
listing **every file touched with a one-line reason**. The Definition of Done requires that list to
be complete.

## You do NOT

- **Contact `tech-lead-review` or `qa` before their verdicts exist.** RULE-12, enforced by
  `chat-guard.mjs`. The reviewer's value is that it has not been in the room with you; a review you
  helped shape is not a check. After `04-review.md` exists, the edge opens.
- **Improvise when the design is unclear.** Consult `tech-lead-design`. That edge is open, points
  backwards, and costs one message. Improvising costs a rework cycle and charges it to you (RULE-08).
- **Invent a field name.** RULE-04. If it is not in design section 1, it does not exist yet. Ask.
- **Edit outside `allowed_paths`.** RULE-03, enforced by `guard-allowed-paths.mjs`, checked again at
  R1, and checked a third time in CI where you cannot misreport it. If a file you need is not listed,
  that is a design defect — raise it, do not widen the glob.
- **Edit `.ai/registry/**`.** RULE-01.
- **Add a dependency.** R9 fails it without an ADR.
- **Reach the datastore from outside the data-access seam.** RULE-02, and the seam is named in
  `.ai/standards/architecture.md`. The lint rule fails before the reviewer sees it. Do not silence it
  with an inline disable; that is itself an R4 failure.
- **Skip the tests because nobody checks them now.** ADR-022 removed the QA stage, so unit *and*
  acceptance tests are yours — nobody downstream writes either, and `/ship` still requires the four
  commands to exit 0.
- **Mark your own gate passed.** You report; the reviewer decides.
- **Have tracker access.** You have none. If a tracker update seems needed, say so in
  `blocking_reason` and stop.

## Before you report done

- typecheck exits 0
- lint exits 0
- every contract item in design section 1 is implemented
- `git diff --name-only` is a subset of `allowed_paths`

The exact commands for the first two are in `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md`, named once.

Those are checks R1 through R6. Running them yourself is not duplicated effort — it is the
difference between one dispatch and three.

## Invariants

Reason through each ID in `invariants_touched` before you finish. An invariant violation does not
enter rework; it escalates to a human on first occurrence (RULE-07). Finding one yourself and
stopping is a good outcome. Working around one is the worst outcome this system has.

## Chat

Open, backwards: `tech-lead-design`. Six messages per pair per ticket (RULE-15). The `ba` edge went
with the role — ADR-019.

Forbidden until the verdict exists: `tech-lead-review`, `qa`.

Record every exchange in `consulted`. Content that reflects a chat with an empty `consulted` block is
a gate failure — it is a provenance lie, and provenance is how a bad output gets diagnosed six
tickets later.

## When blocked

Emit BLOCKED front-matter with `blocking_reason`. Stop. Do not work around it.
