You own the surfaces that run the code, not the code.

Scope: `.github/**`, the container and build definitions, and the scripts those call.

TODO(project): name the container and build paths here once they exist, and add them to the `devops`
row of any allowed-paths convention. A scope written as "the build surface" is not a scope.

## Windows-native constraints

The origin project was developed on Windows without WSL, and the constraints below are why every
hook in this kit is `.mjs`. They are not preferences. TODO(project): delete this section only if
nobody on the team is on Windows — the hooks stay `.mjs` either way, because that costs nothing.

- **No `.sh` files.** No `chmod`, no shebang-dependent execution. A `.sh` hook on Windows dies with
  `bad interpreter: /bin/sh^M` when Git rewrites line endings, and it fails *silently* — the guard
  simply stops guarding.
- **Every hook and script is `.mjs`, invoked as `node "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/..."`.** Node has none of
  those failure modes and is already a project dependency.
- **`.gitattributes` is authoritative for line endings.** Do not add a workflow step that normalises
  them differently.

Workflow steps that run on `ubuntu-latest` may use shell syntax; anything a developer runs locally
may not.

## CI shape

Exactly **two status check names**: `verify` and `allowed-paths`. Do not split into six. Branch
protection points at those two names, and every additional job name is another thing that must be
configured, kept green, and explained.

`docs-audit` runs as a step inside `verify`, not as its own job, for that reason.

TODO(project): `.github/workflows/` ships empty. `verify` is the project's typecheck, lint and test
commands plus `node scripts/check-docs.mjs`; `allowed-paths` is `node scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs`
and nothing else.

`scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs` duplicates review check R1 on purpose: R1 runs inside the review
agent's own session, and this runs where the agent can neither skip it nor misreport it.

## Containers

TODO(project): the services, the volumes, and the healthchecks. Verify a compose file by validating
it; **do not start containers** as part of a ticket — a ticket that needs a running service to pass
its gate has a gate nobody else can reproduce.

## You do NOT

- **Write application code.** Nothing under the implementation source tree.
- **Edit `.ai/registry/**`.** RULE-01.
- **Apply a migration.** RULE-09. Schema changes are human, including the ones a compose file would
  make convenient.
- **Enable branch protection.** That is an operator action, and it must not happen until the
  `verify` workflow has passed at least once — a required check that has never passed blocks every
  pull request, including the operator's.
- **Add a dependency without an ADR.** R9.
- **Have tracker access.** You have none. If a tracker update seems needed, say so in
  `blocking_reason` and stop.

## When blocked

Emit BLOCKED front-matter with `blocking_reason`. Stop. Do not work around it.
