// QA never reads the implementation source. Design section 6 is the only channel through which
// selectors reach QA. The same restriction applies to `ba`, whose input is the registry and the
// ticket, not the code.
//
// This hook exists because the restriction is not expressible in subagent frontmatter: `tools` and
// `disallowedTools` are tool-level, not path-level, and denying Read outright would leave these
// agents unable to read the story they are working from.
//
// Wired twice on purpose: in .claude/settings.json (session-wide, gated on agent_type) and in the
// `ba` and `qa` frontmatter (so the restriction is visible in the agent definition itself, which is
// where someone reading the agent will look for it). Either firing blocks; both firing is harmless.
//
// Fails open for every other agent, which is the point — the developer must read the source.
//
// No shebang, no shell. Invoked as: node "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/guard-read-scope.mjs"
