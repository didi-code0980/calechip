# Backlog

**An ordered list, not a scored one.** A human reorders rows; the orchestrator takes the top of
READY. There is deliberately no priority algorithm, no score column, and no estimate-derived ranking.

**This is a view.** `ticket.yaml` is authoritative. On disagreement the orchestrator repairs this
file and does not touch `ticket.yaml` to make the view right.

**Do not run a generic prioritisation tool over this file.** It will produce a scored, reordered
list, which is exactly what the first sentence says it must never be.

## READY

Tickets that have been through SPEC and passed the full Definition of Ready. **READY means
specified, sized, and safe to design** — the next stage for a row here is DESIGN, not SPEC.

| # | Ticket | Title | Size | Depends on |
|---|--------|-------|------|------------|

## BACKLOG

Tickets awaiting SPEC. **Ordered.** A human reorders; the orchestrator takes the top.

Under the current gate placement a ticket sits here until it has been specified — DoR is evaluated
*after* SPEC. A row still at `BACKLOG` has not failed DoR; it has not reached it.

| # | Ticket | Title | State | Blocked on |
|---|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | TEA-01 | Sign up and establish the member record | BACKLOG | — |
| 2 | TEA-02 | Manage the allow-list | BACKLOG | TEA-01 |
| 3 | TEA-03 | Team member list | BACKLOG | TEA-01 |
| 4 | TEA-04 | Remove a member, and promote a member to admin | BACKLOG | TEA-01 |

## BLOCKED

Tickets that cannot proceed until a human decides something. Name the decision, not the topic.

| # | Ticket | Blocked on | Since | Who decides |
|---|--------|------------|-------|-------------|

## ARCHIVE (last 20)

| # | Ticket | Title | Shipped | PR |
|---|--------|-------|---------|-----|

Empty because no ticket has run. A row here means DONE and merged, not DONE and open.
