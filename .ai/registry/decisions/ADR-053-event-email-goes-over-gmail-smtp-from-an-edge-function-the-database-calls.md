# ADR-053 — Event email goes over Gmail SMTP, from one Edge Function the database calls

## Status

`ACCEPTED by tech-lead-design` — 2026-10-09, at `/plan` of `EVT-05`.

**Inside the envelope, so accepted by the agent (RULE-09, ADR-008).** It supersedes and reverses
nothing. [ADR-051](ADR-051-a-server-side-component-sends-event-email-and-authorizes-nothing.md)
decision 1 leaves the mechanism to `tech-lead-design` at `/plan` of `EVT-05`; this ADR is that
choice. Its decision 7 leaves the provider, the key holder and the sending domain to the operator;
this ADR **records** the operator's answers and authors none of them. The operator reviews it at
merge (CODEOWNERS).

## Context

- ADR-051 admits one server-side component whose whole job is sending event email, which authorizes
  nothing and which the browser never calls.
- `EVT-04` (ADR-050) already writes one `public.notification` row per recipient, from definer
  triggers, only to people who can read the event and never to the actor. Every email ADR-051
  decision 4 names is one of its kinds: `event_created` (narrowed to own-team events),
  `event_invited`, `attendance_approved`, `attendance_rejected`, `attendance_removed`.
- **The operator's answers to idea Q6**, recorded in
  `.ai/board/ideas/2026-10-08-a-person-learns-about-an-event-only-by-going-to-look.md` § *Evidence*:
  Gmail over SMTP with an App Password (*"chọn cách B"*, over the Gmail API with OAuth); no sending
  domain, so no SPF or DKIM records are owed; the sending account is `didi00889900@gmail.com`; the
  From header is `CaleChip <didi00889900@gmail.com>`, the account address itself; the credentials
  live in the gitignored `supabase/functions/.env` and reach the hosted project through
  `supabase secrets set`.
- Supabase's hosted Edge Functions refuse outgoing connections on ports 25 and 587; the sender uses
  465, implicit TLS. TODO(verify) with one real send from the deployed function.

## Decision

1. **The component is one Supabase Edge Function, `send-event-email`**, under
   `supabase/functions/send-event-email/`. It is the product's only server-side code.
2. **The database calls it, nothing else does.** An `after insert` trigger on `public.notification`
   whose kind is one of the five above — `event_created` only when the event's scope is own team —
   posts one request per row through the `pg_net` extension. The request carries everything the
   message needs; **the function holds no database credential and reads nothing.**
3. **The database decides who is mailed.** The trigger skips a recipient who switched event email
   off, and inherits from ADR-050 that every row is already addressed to someone who can read the
   event, other than the actor. The function applies no recipient rule of its own.
4. **The call is authenticated with a shared secret**, held in Supabase Vault on the database side
   and in the function's environment on the other. The function's URL lives in Vault too, so no
   migration carries a project address or a secret. A request without the secret is refused.
5. **The mail is sent through Gmail's SMTP server on port 465 with the account's App Password**,
   using the `nodemailer` package imported as `npm:nodemailer` with its major pinned in the import.
   That is the only dependency this ADR adds, and it is reachable only from
   `supabase/functions/send-event-email/`.
6. **A failed send is logged and never retried.** The action that caused it has already committed and
   is never rolled back (ADR-051 § *Consequences*); the trigger swallows its own failure so a missing
   extension, secret or function never fails a user's write. The record of a failure is the
   function's log and `pg_net`'s response table.

## Rationale

**Rejected: the function reads the notification itself, with the service-role key**, given only a
row id. It shrinks what a leaked hook secret can do — re-send real mail, not write arbitrary mail —
but it puts the key that bypasses every row-level policy into the one component ADR-051 says
authorizes nothing, and makes the function's reads a second place where recipients could be decided.
A function that cannot read the database cannot be the component that broke ADR-051 decision 2.

**Rejected: a Supabase Database Webhook configured in the dashboard.** It is `pg_net` underneath, but
it lives outside the migrations, so no review sees it and no fresh project reproduces it.

**Rejected: the browser asks the function to send after each action.** ADR-051 decision 3 forbids
the browser calling it, and a tab closed between the action and the call loses the mail silently.

**Rejected: an SMTP client written by hand over `Deno.connectTls`.** It removes the dependency, but
MIME, UTF-8 headers for Vietnamese names, and `AUTH LOGIN` are exactly where a hand-written client
fails quietly, and a lost email is not visible to anybody.

**Rejected: the Gmail API over OAuth** — the operator's own Q6 branch A, offered and not chosen.

## Consequences

- **A Gmail account's daily sending limit is the product's.** A team event mails every other approved
  member of the team at once; a team larger than Gmail's per-day cap would lose the excess. Not
  reached at this product's size; recorded so it is not a surprise.
- **Deploying is three manual steps beside `pnpm build`**, all human (RULE-09): apply the migration;
  `supabase secrets set --env-file supabase/functions/.env` and
  `supabase functions deploy send-event-email --no-verify-jwt`; create the two Vault secrets. The
  function checks its own secret, which is why the platform's JWT check is switched off for it.
- **Until those steps are done, nothing is mailed and nothing fails.** The trigger finds no Vault
  secret and does nothing.
- **Who holds the Gmail account is not recorded.** The operator supplied its App Password; whoever
  can sign in to `didi00889900@gmail.com` can read every reply and bounce, and can revoke the
  password, which stops all event email.
- **ADR-051 § *Consequences*' line on SPF and DKIM no longer applies**: mail leaves from a Gmail
  address on Google's own domain. Its text is unchanged.
- **`.ai/standards/tech-stack.md` should name the Edge Function runtime and this package.** That
  file's own last section says an agent stops rather than edits it, so the line is owed to `/thuki`
  rather than written by the ticket that needed it.

## Revert condition

Either, one occurrence:

1. **The function is given a database credential, or reads or writes product data.** On
   observation: remove it; decision 2 has been broken, and ADR-051 decision 2 with it.
2. **The package is imported anywhere outside `supabase/functions/send-event-email/`.** On
   observation: remove the import.

ADR-051's own two revert conditions apply on top.

## Affected documents

- `.ai/board/tickets/EVT-05/01-plan.md` — the contract this ADR's decisions become.
- `.ai/standards/data-model.md`, `.ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md` — the opt-out column, its RPC
  and the trigger. Written by `EVT-05`.
- `.ai/standards/tech-stack.md` — owed to `/thuki` (Consequences, last item).
