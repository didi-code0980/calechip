// SOLO, 2026-09-12 — ADR-035. The `manager` rank, at the seam.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**, so nothing here is numbered `AC-n`:
// that prefix is a claim that a plan document states the criterion. `.claude/agents/solo.md` and
// ADR-035 are the authority, and each test below names the clause of that ADR it asserts.
//
// **THE MOCK IS THE SUBJECT AND THE MIGRATION IS WHAT IT REPRODUCES.** `public.may_decide`, the
// `entry_update_manager` policy and clauses (a) and (a2) of `public.entry_enforce_decision()` live in
// `supabase/migrations/20260912100000_solo_manager_role.sql` and are exercised by NO test until a
// project is provisioned — RULE-09 keeps applying it human, and `tests/permission-model.test.ts`
// still does not exist. What can be asserted here is that the mock refuses where the datastore
// refuses, and that matters because the acceptance suite drives the mock (BUG-001,
// `tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts`): a permissive mock would let every manager test in that suite pass
// against a datastore nobody has checked.
//
// **NO NEW FIXTURE MEMBER, DELIBERATELY.** Adding a seventh person to the team would move INV-04's
// denominator, the sidebar's `TEAM (n)` count and every roster assertion in the browser suite. Each
// test here promotes an EXISTING fixture member to `manager` through the seam and puts the rank back
// afterwards, which also exercises `setMemberRole` on the way in.
//
// EVERY TEST RESTORES WHAT IT WROTE. `members` is module state that lives for the whole file and the
// mock offers no reseed, so a test that left somebody a manager would silently change what every
// test after it asserts against.
