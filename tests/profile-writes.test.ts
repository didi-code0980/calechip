// SOLO, 2026-09-10 — the two profile writes, below the interface.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**, so nothing here is numbered `AC-n`:
// that prefix is a claim that a plan document states the criterion. `.claude/agents/solo.md` and
// ADR-033 are the authority.
//
// **THE MOCK IS THE SUBJECT AND THE MIGRATION IS WHAT IT REPRODUCES.** `member_update_own` and the
// two new trigger clauses live in
// `supabase/migrations/20260910093000_solo_profile_self_update.sql` and are exercised by NO test
// until a project is provisioned — RULE-09 keeps applying it human. What can be asserted here is
// that the mock refuses where the datastore refuses, and that matters because the acceptance suite
// drives the mock (BUG-001, `tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts`): a permissive mock would let every profile
// test in that suite pass against a datastore nobody has checked.
//
// **THE PASSWORD BRANCHES ARE HERE AND NOT IN THE BROWSER SUITE**, because the observable proof that
// a password changed is that the OLD one stops working — which costs a sign-out, two sign-ins and a
// restore. Below the interface it is four calls.
//
// **THE OFFERED-AVATAR RULE IS THE SEAM'S ALONE.** That migration deliberately carries no check
// constraint on `avatar` — the first draft had one and it aborted on real seed data, which is how
// the whole file came to be unapplied. Step 3 of the migration records why at length. So these tests
// are not a mock agreeing with a constraint; they are the only statement of the rule that exists.
//
// EVERY TEST RESTORES WHAT IT WROTE. `members` and `passwordOverrides` are module state that lives
// for the whole file, and the mock offers no reseed, so a test that renamed a fixture member and
// left them renamed would silently change what every test after it asserts against.
