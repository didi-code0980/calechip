// CAL-05 — the week view: who is away this week, for how much of each day, why, and who agreed.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.2 and 4.3. Every locator is a `data-testid` from the
// selector table in section 4.3; the two this file uses that are NOT in that table — `week-sign-in`
// and `home-week-link` — are declared in 03-impl-log.md § Deviations.
//
// **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH tests/absence.test.ts IS THE STANDARD'S.**
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts pure logic at the unit level and "a full acceptance
// criterion through the interface" at this one. So AC-2's, AC-4's, AC-5's, AC-9's and AC-12's
// derivation is asserted there against `absentEntriesFor` directly, and this file asserts what a
// person SEES: the seven sections, the portions, the notes, the approver, the empty day, the address
// bar, and — AC-8 — the controls that are not there. AC-4 and AC-12 appear in both, because a
// five-day afternoon that derives correctly and renders as a whole day is still a wrong screen.
//
// **AC-10, AC-11 AND AC-15 ARE ASSERTED IN tests/absence.test.ts OR NOWHERE, AND THAT IS DECLARED
// IN 03-impl-log.md.**
// - AC-10 (a rejected entry is not listed) — nothing in the product can set `status` to `rejected`:
//   the insert grant excludes it, `entry_update_admin` excludes it, and ADM-05 does not exist. The
//   criterion has no interface to be observed through, so it is a unit test against the derivation.
// - AC-11 (a removed member's entries stop on the removal day) — nothing can remove a member partway
//   through a displayed week either; TEA-04's control writes `removed_at` as `now()`. Unit test.
// - AC-15 (a truncated read is refused) — a `>= MONTH_ENTRY_LIMIT` throw inside the seam. The mock's
//   entry table is bounded by the fixtures and cannot reach 2000 rows, and no test can make
//   PostgREST cap a read without a provisioned project. It is the same untested shape ROSTER_LIMIT,
//   OWN_ENTRY_LIMIT, TEAM_ENTRY_LIMIT and CAL-04's AC-11 already carry.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise), so the team scoping asserted below is the mock's reproduction of `entry_select_team`
// and `member_select_team`. This ticket ships no policy and no migration — every read it makes was
// already permitted (01-plan.md sections 3, 5 and 6).
//
// EACH TEST GETS FRESH MOCK STATE, because the mock's tables and its session live in module memory
// and a `page.goto` reloads the module. Navigation WITHIN a test is therefore done by clicking links
// and by `page.goBack()`, both of which react-router handles client-side — the constraint CAL-01's,
// CAL-02's, CAL-03's and CAL-04's suites all record.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql):
// - Admin:      quan@example.com  (FIXTURE_ADMIN, "Quản trị", owl) — approved FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY
// - Member:     thanh@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER, "Thành viên", cat) — owns nothing
// - Approved:   linh@example.com  (FIXTURE_APPROVED_MEMBER, "Đã duyệt") owns FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY
// - Other team: chi@other.example.com (FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_MEMBER) owns FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_ENTRY

// `approved` by FIXTURE_ADMIN, and carries a note. FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_ENTRY runs 21 to 22 September
