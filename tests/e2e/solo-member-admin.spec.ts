// SOLO, 2026-09-10 — the member tab gains a team column, a last-sign-in column and three row actions.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**, so the numbering below is local to this
// file and is deliberately NOT `AC-n`. What authorises it is `.claude/agents/solo.md`.
//
// **NO IMAGE WAS ATTACHED WITH THE REQUEST**, though it said *"như design trên hình"*. What the
// operator specified in words is which columns and which actions; the arrangement is the agent's own
// and is marked as such in `MemberList.tsx` — `.ai/standards/ui-design-system.md` § *Visual
// specification*. Nothing below asserts a layout, only which facts and which controls are present.
//
// **TWO OF THE SIX COLUMNS COULD NOT BE BUILT AS ASKED, AND BOTH LIMITS ARE ASSERTED HERE RATHER
// THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED:**
//   * *Delete account* is a SOFT remove (test 4). A hard delete of `auth.users` needs the
//     service-role key and therefore a server ADR-005 refuses, and it would break ADR-013 — a
//     removed member counts until the day they were removed, and INV-04 divides by that. The
//     operator was asked and chose the soft remove.
//   * *Change team* offers ONE team (test 5). `member_update_admin`'s `with check` is
//     `team_id = member_team_id(auth.uid())`, so the only team an admin can write is their own.
//
// **`last_sign_in_at` IS A COLUMN THIS CHANGE CREATED.** GoTrue holds the original on
// `auth.users`, which is not exposed through PostgREST, so the browser cannot read it; a trigger
// copies it onto `public.member`, where `member_select_team` already decides who may read it.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, `tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts` refuses the run
// otherwise), so the refusals below are the mock's reproduction of the policies.
