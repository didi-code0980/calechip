// UIE-09 — the admin hub at `/admin`, and the one top-bar control that reaches it.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md § 2 and § 4.5. Every locator is a `data-testid` from the selector table in
// § 4.5, plus `sign-in-*`, `home-*` and the five destinations' own screen ids — the last group is
// READ and never written, which is what AC-4 and AC-10 are.
//
// **`page.goto` IS USED FREELY HERE, WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THIS SUITE AND IS SAFE FOR ONE REASON.**
// Every other acceptance file navigates by clicking, because the mock seam's tables live in module
// memory and a document load resets them — so a `goto` after a write loses the entry the test just
// created. THIS TICKET WRITES NOTHING: it adds no form, no seam write and no state to lose, and the
// SESSION does survive a reload (the mock stores it in `localStorage`, `src/lib/data/mock.ts:167`).
// Typing an address is also the only way to express half of these criteria — AC-6 and AC-7 are both
// about a caller for whom no link exists.
//
// **THE `unavailable` BRANCH IS ASSERTED NEGATIVELY, WHICH IS THIS SUITE'S ESTABLISHED READING.**
// AC-8's two halves are one `catch`, and the mock seam does not fail on demand — `cal-04`, `cal-05`,
// `adm-02`, `adm-04` and `cal-10` all assert their own `*-unavailable` with `toHaveCount(0)` for
// exactly this reason, and `cal-10`'s header states it in terms. So what is asserted below is that a
// SUCCESSFUL read never renders it and that a REFUSAL never renders it either, which is the half of
// AC-8 that matters: a denial and a transport failure must not read alike. Nothing here claims to
// have exercised a throwing read.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise), so the refusals below are the mock's reproduction of the roles the real policies hold.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql):
// - Admin:       quan@example.com  (FIXTURE_ADMIN, role admin)
// - Member:      thanh@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER, role member)
// - Member-less: hoa@example.com   (FIXTURE_MEMBER_LESS, signed in, no member row at all) — AC-7

 * SOME SCREENS HAVE TWO SUCH IDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LIST AND AN EMPTY STATE, and which of the two
