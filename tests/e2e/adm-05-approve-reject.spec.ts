// ADM-05 — approve or reject an entry, with a reason on rejection.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.4 and 4.5. Every locator is a `data-testid` from the
// selector table in section 4.5; the ones this file uses that are NOT in that table — `sign-in-*`,
// `home-sign-out`, `home-new-entry-link`, `home-team-entries-link`, `home-pending-entries-link`,
// `new-entry-*`, `own-entry-row*`, `edit-entry-form`, `edit-entry-submit`, `team-entry-row*`,
// `pending-entry-row*` — belong to TEA-01, TEA-05, CAL-01, CAL-02, CAL-03 and ADM-04 and are
// declared in 03-impl-log.md § Deviations.
//
// **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH tests/entry-decision.test.ts IS THE STANDARD'S.**
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts seam behaviour at the unit level and "a full acceptance
// criterion through the interface" at this one. So the transitions, the provenance and the two
// refusal codes are asserted there against `approveEntry` and `rejectEntry` directly, and this file
// asserts what an ADMIN and a MEMBER SEE: the queue shrinking, the count falling with it, the reason
// field refusing to be skipped, the reason reaching its subject with nobody telling them, the
// controls that exist on each status and the one that exists on none.
//
// **AC-6, AC-7, AC-10, AC-12, AC-13, AC-14, AC-16 AND AC-17 ARE ASSERTED IN
// tests/entry-decision.test.ts OR NOWHERE, AND THAT IS DECLARED IN 03-impl-log.md.** Each is a
// property of the write and not of a screen: the tentative flag surviving, the approver being the
// actor rather than the sender, self-approval, INV-02's reset on an edit, and the three refusals
// whose only interface consequence is a sentence this file already asserts once.
//
// **AC-8 AND AC-9 HAVE NO INTERFACE HALF TO ASSERT, AND THE ABSENCE IS ASSERTED INSTEAD.** A member
// cannot reach the panel: `/entries/pending` refuses them, and `/entries/:id/edit` mounts the panel
// for an admin only. So what is checked here is that a member standing on their own rejected entry
// is offered NO decision control at all — the affordance half — while the refusal itself is clause
// (a)'s and is demonstrated against the mock in the unit suite. 01-plan.md Open questions item 2
// states what that does and does not prove.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise), so every refusal observed below is src/lib/data/mock.ts reproducing
// `entry_update_admin` and clauses (a) and (b) of `public.entry_enforce_decision()`. The migration
// this ticket ships is applied by a human (RULE-09) and is not exercised here.
//
// EACH TEST GETS FRESH MOCK STATE, because the mock's entry table lives in module memory and a
// `page.goto` reloads the module. ITS SESSION DOES NOT: mock.ts writes the session to
// `localStorage`, so switching people is done by signing out, and navigation within a test is done
// by clicking links and by `page.goBack()` — the constraint every suite from CAL-01 onwards records.
//
// THE ENTRIES BELOW ARE CREATED THROUGH CAL-01'S FORM AND NOT SEEDED — 01-plan.md section 7 adds no
// fixture on purpose, and every criterion here is stronger created by the write it is testing. The
// two seeded rows both matter by staying where they are: FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY is on the team list
// and off the worklist, and FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_ENTRY is pending and invisible to this team.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql):
// - Admin:  quan@example.com  (FIXTURE_ADMIN, role admin, FIXTURE_TEAM, no seeded entries)
// - Member: thanh@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER, role member, FIXTURE_TEAM, no seeded entries)
