// CAL-08 — holidays and bridge days drawn in the month, week and year grids.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. Every locator is a `data-testid` from
// the selector table in section 4.4; the ones this file uses that are NOT in that table —
// `month-sign-in`, `week-sign-in`, `year-sign-in`, `home-week-link`, `home-year-link`,
// `home-holidays-link`, `home-threshold-link`, `holiday-add-*`, `threshold-*` — belong to CAL-04,
// CAL-05, CAL-06, ADM-01 and ADM-03 and are declared in 03-impl-log.md § Deviations.
//
// **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH tests/day-status.test.ts IS THE STANDARD'S.**
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts pure logic at the unit level and "a full acceptance
// criterion through the interface" at this one. So the DERIVATION behind AC-1 to AC-4 is asserted
// there against `dayStatusesFor` directly, and this file asserts what a person SEES: the lavender
// cell and the name in it, the bridge badge that is deliberately not lavender, the strip under the
// year's month ruler, the sentence an empty year says, and — AC-13 — the controls that are not
// there. AC-1 to AC-4 appear in both, because a derivation that is right and a screen that draws it
// wrong are two different failures.
//
// **AC-5, AC-12 AND AC-15 ARE ASSERTED IN tests/day-status.test.ts OR NOWHERE, AND THAT IS DECLARED
// IN 03-impl-log.md.** It is the same shape CAL-05 recorded for its AC-10, AC-11 and AC-15 and
// CAL-06 for its AC-7, AC-8 and AC-14:
// - AC-5 (bridge-ness at the first and last day of the range) is invisible here BY CONSTRUCTION: all
//   three views pad their own read, so a screen that got it wrong would look right. The unit test
//   asserts both directions, including that the bare range answers wrongly.
// - AC-12 (a failed or truncated holiday read shows no shading and says so) is a throw inside the
//   seam. The mock's holiday table holds five rows at most in this file and cannot reach
//   `HOLIDAY_LIMIT`, and no test can make PostgREST cap a read without a provisioned project. The
//   BRANCH is the `unavailable` state each view already renders and each earlier suite already
//   covers; what is untested is the throw reaching it.
// - AC-15 (the answer does not depend on the machine's timezone) needs the process timezone changed
//   under the derivation, which a browser test cannot do.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise). This ticket ships no policy and no migration — `holiday_select_all` is ADM-02's and
// admits both roles, which is why AC-13's two halves are identical rather than a permission test
// (01-plan.md sections 3, 5 and 6).
//
// EACH TEST GETS FRESH MOCK STATE, because the mock's tables and its session live in module memory
// and a `page.goto` reloads the module. Navigation WITHIN a test is therefore done by clicking links
// and by `page.goBack()`, both of which react-router handles client-side — the constraint every
// suite from CAL-01 onwards records. Two tests below EXPLOIT that reset rather than working around
// it: AC-13 opens the same address twice as two different people, which is safe precisely because
// nothing either of them did is meant to survive.
//
// Holiday fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql). ADM-02 shipped the four
// rows ADR-015 § 5 specified and THIS TICKET ADDS NONE — every weekday below was computed there
// rather than recalled, and tests/day-status.test.ts asserts them again so a wrong one fails at the
// unit level rather than here:
// - 2026-06-11 Thursday, `non_working`, "Ngày lễ thử nghiệm"
// - 2026-06-13 Saturday, `working`,     "Làm bù thử nghiệm"    — the mandated swap day
// - 2026-06-15 Monday,   `non_working`, "Nghỉ bù thử nghiệm"
// - 2026-10-15 Thursday, `non_working`, "Ngày nghỉ thử nghiệm" — Friday the 16th is the bridge day
// - 2027 carries NO ROW AT ALL, which is AC-8's fixture.
//
// Member fixtures: FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY runs 14 to 16 September 2026, is `full`, `pto` and
// `approved`, and its owner is the only person away in that month. The team's `overloadThreshold` is
// 0.5 and four of the five members are active, so one person away is NOT crowded — which is why
// AC-10 lowers the threshold through ADM-01's control rather than moving three people.
