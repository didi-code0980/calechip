// CAL-10 — the year overview, through the browser. 01-plan.md section 2, inside ADR-032.
//
// **WHAT IS ASSERTED HERE AND WHAT IS ASSERTED IN `tests/absence.test.ts`.**
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts pure logic at the unit level and rendering at this one.
// AC-6's partition identity and AC-8's fraction are properties of `absenceByTypeFor` and are proved
// against `absenceCountsFor` over the same fixtures there — the cheapest possible check of ADR-032's
// revert condition. What this file adds is that the SCREEN shows those numbers: a derivation that is
// right and a card that reads a different value are the same defect to a person looking at it.
//
// **THE `unavailable` BRANCH IS ASSERTED NEGATIVELY, WHICH IS THIS SUITE'S ESTABLISHED READING.**
// AC-14's third state and AC-15 are the same `catch`, and the mock seam does not fail on demand —
// `cal-04`, `cal-05`, `adm-02` and `adm-04` all assert their own `*-unavailable` with
// `toHaveCount(0)` for exactly this reason. So the assertion below is that a SUCCESSFUL read never
// renders it, which is what keeps "the year is quiet" and "the read failed" from ever being the same
// screen. Nothing here claims to have exercised a throwing read.
//
// Fixtures this file leans on, from `src/lib/fixtures.ts`:
// - FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY runs 14 to 16 September 2026, `full`, `pto`, `approved`, owned by
//   FIXTURE_APPROVED_MEMBER. It is the ONLY entry the caller's team holds in 2026, which is what
//   makes every figure below a small number somebody can check by hand.
// - FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_ENTRY runs 21 to 22 September 2026 and belongs to the OTHER TEAM, so INV-07
//   is observable: it must be in no figure on this screen.
// - Three NON-WORKING 2026 holidays (11 June, 15 June, 15 October) and one WORKING Saturday
//   (13 June, a mandated make-up day). AC-7 turns on the mandated Saturday not being counted.
