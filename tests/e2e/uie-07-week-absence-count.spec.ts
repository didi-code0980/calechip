// UIE-07 — the week view renders a per-day absence count.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 4.2, 4.3 and 7. Every locator is a `data-testid`;
// `week-day-count` is the one this ticket adds and `data-count` / `data-current-members` are the two
// attributes it borrows verbatim from the month grid.
//
// **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH tests/absence.test.ts IS THE STANDARD'S**, and this file exists for
// the half it cannot reach. `tests/absence.test.ts:151-157` already fixes the arithmetic — one
// member's `am` and `pm` on one date is 1 and not 1.5 or 2 — at the unit level, against
// `absenceCountsFor` directly. What is asserted below is that the SCREEN shows what the module says.
// That is the whole of the ticket: INV-04 permits this number on a second surface and forbids a
// second definition of it, and the cheapest wrong path — a local sum over the `absent` map already
// in scope three lines from the strip — needs no new data, reads as reuse, and would pass every
// existing test. AC-3 and AC-4 are the two assertions that catch it.
//
// **AC-9 (`n/0`) IS ASSERTED NOWHERE, AND THAT IS DECLARED IN 03-impl-log.md.** It needs a roster on
// which every member carries a `removedAt`, and nothing in the product can empty a team: TEA-04's
// control writes `removed_at` on one member at a time and the fixture team's four current members
// include the caller, who cannot remove themselves out of the read. The criterion is held by the
// code shape instead — nothing in the strip divides, so there is no `NaN` branch to reach — which is
// the same untested shape CAL-05 AC-10, AC-11 and AC-15 already carry.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise), and EACH TEST GETS FRESH MOCK STATE, so navigation WITHIN a test is by clicking links
// and by `page.goBack()` — a `page.goto` reloads the module and loses both the session and every
// entry the test created.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts). The team holds FIVE members and ONE of them carries a `removedAt`,
// so the denominator is FOUR on every assertion below — computed by `currentMemberCount`, never a
// literal in the product. `tests/e2e/cal-04-month-view.spec.ts:226` reads the same 4 off
// `month-threshold`. FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY runs 14 to 16 September 2026, is `full` and `approved`;
// FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_ENTRY runs 21 to 22 September and belongs to the other team, which is what
// makes the week of 21 September empty for this caller rather than untested.
