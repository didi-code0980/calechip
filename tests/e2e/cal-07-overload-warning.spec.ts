// CAL-07 — the overload warning, shown while choosing dates and before the entry is saved.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md sections 2, 4.2 and 4.3. Every locator is a `data-testid` from the table in
// section 4.3, plus `data-type` on `<prefix>-overload-person`, which is declared in 03-impl-log.md as
// an addition: the plan requires PTO peach and WFH mint on those markers, and
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` forbids asserting on a style class, so without the attribute
// that requirement is unobservable through the interface.
//
// **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH tests/draft-entry.test.ts IS THE STANDARD'S.** Pure logic is at the
// unit level, "a full acceptance criterion through the interface" is here. So AC-4, AC-5, AC-8,
// AC-17 and AC-18's arithmetic is asserted there against the real `absenceCountsFor`, and this file
// asserts what a person SEES: the block, the day it names, the people on it, the save control beside
// it, and the moment the warning goes away. AC-4, AC-8 and AC-17 appear in both, because a count
// that sums correctly and renders as a different number is still a wrong screen.
//
// **AC-15 AND AC-21 ARE NOT ASSERTED ANYWHERE, and both absences are declared in 03-impl-log.md.**
// AC-15 is a claim about `.ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md`, which is not in `allowed_paths` and
// which RULE-03 forbids this ticket to touch — the diff is the evidence and a test could only
// restate it. AC-21 needs a read that FAILS or that the seam refuses as truncated: the mock's entry
// table is bounded by the fixtures and cannot reach MONTH_ENTRY_LIMIT, and no test can make
// PostgREST cap a read without a provisioned project. It is the same untested shape CAL-04 AC-11
// already carries.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise). Nothing asserted below is a refusal, which is the unusual thing about this ticket: the
// warning is an affordance end to end and the datastore is never asked to agree with it.
//
// EACH TEST GETS FRESH MOCK STATE, because the mock's entry table lives in module memory and a
// `page.goto` reloads the module. Navigation WITHIN a test is therefore done by clicking links and
// by `page.goBack()`, both of which react-router handles client-side — the constraint CAL-01's,
// CAL-02's, CAL-03's and CAL-04's suites all record. It is also why each test seeds its own crowded
// day.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql):
// - Admin:      quan@example.com  (FIXTURE_ADMIN, no seeded entries)
// - Member:     thanh@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER, no seeded entries)
// - 2nd admin:  dung@example.com  (FIXTURE_SECOND_ADMIN, no seeded entries)
// - Approved:   linh@example.com  (FIXTURE_APPROVED_MEMBER, owns FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY)
//
// FIXTURE_TEAM has FOUR members with `removed_at is null` and an `overload_threshold` of 0.5, so a
// day is crowded strictly above 2.0 — which is what makes the boundary reachable here: a prospective
// 2.0 raises nothing, 2.5 and 3.0 do. FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY already puts 1.0 on 14, 15 and 16
