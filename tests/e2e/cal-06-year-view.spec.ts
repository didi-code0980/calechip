// CAL-06 — the year view: one row per member across every day of the year.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md sections 2, 2b, 3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Every locator is a `data-testid` from
// the selector table in section 4.3; the two this file uses that are NOT in that table —
// `year-sign-in` and `home-year-link` — are declared in 03-impl-log.md § Deviations.
//
// **THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH tests/absence.test.ts IS THE STANDARD'S.**
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts pure logic at the unit level and "a full acceptance
// criterion through the interface" at this one. So the DERIVATION behind AC-4, AC-6, AC-9 and AC-10
// is asserted there against `absentDatesByMember` directly, and this file asserts what a person
// SEES: the 365 columns, the row for somebody who declared nothing, the two types telling themselves
// apart, the totals strip, the address bar, and — the read-only denial — the controls that are not
// there. AC-9 and AC-10 appear in both, because a derivation that agrees with the count and a screen
// that draws it wrong are two different failures.
//
// **AC-7, AC-8 AND AC-14 ARE ASSERTED IN tests/absence.test.ts OR NOWHERE, AND THAT IS DECLARED IN
// 03-impl-log.md.** It is the same shape CAL-05 recorded for its AC-10, AC-11 and AC-15:
// - AC-7 (a rejected entry fills nothing) — nothing in the product can set `status` to `rejected`:
//   the insert grant excludes it, `entry_update_admin` excludes it, and ADM-05 does not exist.
// - AC-8 (a removed member's row stops on the removal day) — nothing can remove a member partway
//   through a displayed year either; TEA-04's control writes `removed_at` as `now()`.
// - AC-14 (a truncated read is refused) — a `>= MONTH_ENTRY_LIMIT` throw inside the seam. The mock's
//   entry table is bounded by the fixtures and cannot reach 2000 rows, and no test can make
//   PostgREST cap a read without a provisioned project.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise), so the team scoping asserted below is the mock's reproduction of `entry_select_team`
// and `member_select_team`. This ticket ships no policy and no migration — every read it makes was
// already permitted (01-plan.md sections 3, 5 and 6).
//
// EACH TEST GETS FRESH MOCK STATE, because the mock's tables and its session live in module memory
// and a `page.goto` reloads the module. Navigation WITHIN a test is therefore done by clicking links
// and by `page.goBack()`, both of which react-router handles client-side — the constraint every
// suite from CAL-01 onwards records.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql). THE ROSTER OF THE MAIN TEAM IS FIVE
// MEMBERS, which is what makes AC-3 observable: only one of them owns an entry in 2026.
// - Admin:      quan@example.com  (FIXTURE_ADMIN, "Quan tri", owl) — owns nothing
// - Member:     thanh@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER, "Thanh vien", cat) — owns nothing
// - Second admin: FIXTURE_SECOND_ADMIN — owns nothing, no credential
// - Approved:   linh@example.com  (FIXTURE_APPROVED_MEMBER) owns FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY
// - Removed:    FIXTURE_REMOVED_MEMBER — removed 2026-08-31, owns nothing
// - Member-less: hoa@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER_LESS) has no member row at all
//
// FIXTURE_APPROVED_ENTRY runs 14 to 16 September 2026, is `full`, `pto` and `approved`.
// FIXTURE_OTHER_TEAM_ENTRY runs 21 to 22 September and belongs to the OTHER TEAM, which is what
// makes the emptiness asserted below scoping rather than an empty datastore.
