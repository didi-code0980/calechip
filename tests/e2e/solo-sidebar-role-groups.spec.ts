// SOLO, 2026-09-09 — the sidebar's roster is grouped by role and each group collapses.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**, so the numbering below is local to
// this file and is deliberately NOT `AC-n`: an `AC-` prefix is a claim that a plan document states
// the criterion, and no plan document states these. What authorises the work is
// `.claude/agents/solo.md`; the `ADR-033-solo-engineer.md` that both solo files cite is NOT on disk
// — decisions stop at ADR-032, and `Sidebar.tsx`'s SOLO header records the gap. What this file
// asserts is what the operator asked for, read off the transcription they attached, plus the two
// properties the existing suite could not defend once a roster row acquired a parent.
//
// **WHY THE GROUPING KEY IS `role` AND NOT SUB-TEAM.** The transcription grouped by sub-team —
// `CORE ENGINEERING`, `FRONTEND TEAM`, `QA / TESTING` — and no such field exists anywhere: `Member`
// carries `teamId` and nothing else that partitions a roster, INV-07 makes it one team per member,
// and `member_select_team` scopes `listMembers()` to the caller's own team, so `teamId` yields
// exactly one group forever. The operator was asked and chose `role`. `Sidebar.tsx`'s SOLO header
// note carries the same reasoning at the source.
//
// **THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS MOST HERE IS ONE UIE-10 AC-10 ALREADY HOLDS, AND IT IS NOT RESTATED.**
// That criterion asserts the pane renders exactly one `<button>` — `home-sign-out` — and it is the
// reason the toggle here is a native `<summary>` rather than a button. It passes UNEDITED;
// re-asserting it here would put one fact in two places and make the shipped copy look optional.
// What IS asserted below is the half of it no existing test can see: that a `<summary>` is what the
// disclosure actually is (test 4).
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, `tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts` refuses the run
// otherwise). Fixtures (`src/lib/fixtures.ts`): FIXTURE_TEAM carries four ACTIVE members, TWO
// admins and TWO members — which is what makes a two-group assertion a test rather than a
// tautology, because a roster that fell into one group fails on the count.
