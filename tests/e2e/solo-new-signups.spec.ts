// SOLO, 2026-09-10 — the admin decides who joins, and the allow-list is gone.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**, so the numbering below is local to this
// file and is deliberately NOT `AC-n`. What authorises it is `.claude/agents/solo.md`.
//
// **IT SUPERSEDES ADR-009 AND NO ADR RECORDS THAT YET.** That decision (`ACCEPTED by the operator`,
// 2026-08-31) made the allow-list the gate: an admin typed an address, and a trigger admitted only
// that address. The operator reversed the order on 2026-09-10 — everybody signs up, everybody gets a
// member row, and an admin decides afterwards. The superseding ADR is the operator's to paste;
// `solo` cannot write `.ai/registry/**` (RULE-01).
//
// **THE SECURITY PROPERTY IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE CHANGE AND TEST 4 IS WHERE IT LIVES.** Creating a
// member row at sign-up would, on its own, hand a stranger the entire team's calendar: every
// row-level policy in the product is keyed on `public.member_team_id`, which asked only whether a
// member row existed and was not removed. The migration adds `and m.status = 'approved'` to that one
// function, so an undecided caller is refused by every policy at once. A test that only checked the
// screens would pass with that clause deleted.
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, `tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts` refuses the run
// otherwise), so the refusals below are the mock's reproduction of the policies rather than a second
// story about them.
//
// Fixtures (`src/lib/fixtures.ts`): `FIXTURE_PENDING_SIGNUP` is seeded waiting, with no team and
// `status: "pending"`, so this list is never empty and the row markup is always exercised.
