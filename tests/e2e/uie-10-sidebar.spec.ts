// UIE-10 — the sidebar gives up its admin links and restyles its roster.
//
// Written from 01-plan.md § 2 and § 4. Every locator is a `data-testid`: the one id this ticket
// introduces (`shell-roster-role`), the four it removes, the three it keeps, `shell-admin-link` and
// the `admin-hub-*-link` rows UIE-09 shipped, plus `sign-in-*` and each destination's own refusal —
// the last group is READ and never written, which is what AC-6 is.
//
// **THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE THE SUITE STATES THE MIGRATION AS A PROPERTY RATHER THAN AS AN
// EDIT.** Nine other spec files were amended so that they keep passing; those amendments say what
// each of those tickets still means. What is here is what UIE-10 itself bought, and AC-5 in
// particular is a claim about the WHOLE suite that no other file is positioned to make.
//
// **WHY AC-4 AND AC-5 EXIST AT ALL, because it is the hazard this ticket was triaged around.** Six
// assertions across four files stated that a member is offered no admin surface, each by naming one
// of the four `home-*` admin ids and asserting `toHaveCount(0)`. After AC-1 those four ids render
// for NOBODY, so all six pass VACUOUSLY — an assertion that a named node is absent is satisfied by
// the name never having existed. Six green assertions would then be showing a reader nothing. Each
// was rewritten onto `shell-admin-link`, which renders for an admin and not for a member and can
// therefore still fail; AC-5 is the standing check that no seventh one was introduced here.
//
// `page.goto` IS USED FREELY, which is unusual for this suite and is safe for the reason
// `uie-09-admin-hub.spec.ts` gives: this ticket writes nothing, so a document load has no entry to
// lose, and the mock stores the session in `localStorage` (`src/lib/data/mock.ts:167`).
//
// THE SUITE DRIVES THE MOCK SEAM (BUG-001 pins it, tests/e2e/seam.setup.ts refuses the run
// otherwise), so every refusal below is the mock's reproduction of the roles the real policies hold.
//
// Fixtures (src/lib/fixtures.ts, mirrored in supabase/seed.sql) — FIXTURE_TEAM carries four ACTIVE
// members, two admins and two members, which is what AC-7 needs:
// - Admin:  quan@example.com  (FIXTURE_ADMIN, role admin, `Quản trị`)
// - Member: thanh@example.com (FIXTURE_MEMBER, role member, `Thành viên`)
