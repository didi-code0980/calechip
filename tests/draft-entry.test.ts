//
// `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts "pure logic" at the unit level and "a full acceptance
// criterion through the interface" at the end-to-end one. `withDraft` is pure and so is everything
// it feeds, so AC-4, AC-5, AC-8, AC-17 and AC-18 are asserted here against the real
// `absenceCountsFor` and `absentEntriesFor`, and what a person SEES is in
// tests/e2e/cal-07-overload-warning.spec.ts.
//
// **EVERY ASSERTION COMPOSES `withDraft` WITH absence.ts RATHER THAN INSPECTING THE ARRAY IT
// RETURNS**, which is 01-plan.md section 7's instruction and the point of the module: the array is a
// means and the count is the criterion. A test that asserted the row shape would pass against a
// draft that `absenceCountsFor` then ignored.
//
// **The entries below are constructed here rather than imported, and that is the same declared
// deviation from § Fixtures that tests/absence.test.ts carries** (03-impl-log.md). They are the
// ARGUMENTS of a pure function, not entities: the shapes these criteria distinguish do not exist in
// supabase/seed.sql and cannot be added to it, because seed.sql is not in this ticket's
// `allowed_paths`. Every MEMBER is imported, because members are entities and the attribution
// criteria turn on a real member id.
