// MIR-03, 2026-10-20 — ADR-065 SUPERSEDES ADR-044 DECISION 1. An admin sets a rank on their OWN TEAM
// only, and promotion to admin is `public.promote_member_to_admin`, also own-team. The two tests that
// asserted cross-team success now assert the refusal and are renamed to say so; every other test
// keeps its name and assertion. The header below is ADR-044's and is kept as the history of this
// file. `tests/role-change-bounds.test.ts` carries MIR-03's own acceptance criteria.
//
// SOLO, 2026-09-24 — ADR-044. An admin sets any member's rank, on any team.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**, so nothing here is numbered `AC-n`:
// that prefix is a claim that a plan document states the criterion. `.claude/agents/solo.md` and
// ADR-044 are the authority, and each test names the clause it asserts.
//
// **THE MOCK IS THE SUBJECT AND `public.set_member_role` IS WHAT IT REPRODUCES.** That function
// lives in `supabase/migrations/20260924100000_solo_cross_team_role.sql` and is exercised by NO test
// until a project is provisioned — RULE-09 keeps applying it human, and
// `tests/permission-model.test.ts` still does not exist (`.ai/standards/rbac-and-security.md`
// § Known weaknesses 1). What can be asserted here is that the mock admits where the function admits
// and refuses where it refuses, and that matters because the acceptance suite drives the mock.
//
// **THE DEFECT THIS FILE PINS.** Since `list_all_members()` shipped on 2026-09-11 the Members screen
// has listed every team, while the rank write was a table update admitted by `member_update_admin`,
// whose `using` carries `team_id = member_team_id(auth.uid())`. Pressing *Make manager* on another
// team's row sent a PATCH that matched no row, came back `[]`, and rendered *"That person's role
// could not be changed."* — a true sentence under a button that should not have been there. The
// first test below is that press, and it now succeeds.
//
// EVERY TEST RESTORES WHAT IT WROTE, except the last one, which cannot — see its own note. `members`
// is module state that lives for the whole file and the mock offers no reseed.
