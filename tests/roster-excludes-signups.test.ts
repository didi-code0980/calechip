// SOLO (TEA-09), 2026-09-29 — a sign-up nobody has decided is on no team's roster.
//
// The operator's report: an admin's sidebar listed two waiting sign-ups under MEMBERS. The cause was
// the REAL seam's `listMembers()`, which had no filter and so returned whatever the row-level policies
// admitted — and `member_select_pending_admin` admits every teamless, non-approved row to an admin.
// The mock filtered by team all along, which is why no test saw it.
//
// Two halves, because the two implementations are tested differently:
//   * the MOCK, driven as an admin — the behaviour every screen is written against;
//   * the REAL seam, by its source text — it cannot run without a provisioned project, so this pins
//     the filter the way tests/cross-team-reads.test.ts pins its migration.
