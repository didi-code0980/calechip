// It imports every implementation of the data-access seam and asserts identical exported key sets
// and equal arity per export. That is what makes swapping the mock for the real one a configuration
// change rather than a rewrite.
//
// Parity is necessary and NOT sufficient: matching names and arity does not prove matching return
// shapes, and a mock returning a field the real implementation cannot produce passes this and breaks
// at runtime. Where a shape is subtle, assert it separately.

// The header above says it: matching names and arity does not prove matching return shapes, and
// "where a shape is subtle, assert it". Two of this ticket's are, and both are subtle in the
// direction that PASSES every other test in the repository while being wrong.
//
// These drive the MOCK, through `__setCurrentMember` — the test-only hook mock.ts already exports
// beside `seam`, which parity does not see because parity compares the keys of `seam`. It moves the
// member and not the session, so it reaches a state the application itself cannot; that is exactly
// what is wanted here, because the subject is the seam's answer and not a journey. The real
// implementation's equivalents are `team_select_own` and `date_range=ov.…`, exercised by no test
// until a project is provisioned — 01-plan.md Open questions.
