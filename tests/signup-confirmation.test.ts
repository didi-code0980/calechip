// SOLO, 2026-09-10 — sign-up under both email-confirmation settings.
//
// **THIS WORK CARRIES NO TICKET AND NO ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA.** What authorises it is
// `.claude/agents/solo.md` and the operator's instruction: *"thay đổi config, không cần verify email
// khi đăng kí"*.
//
// **IT IS HERE RATHER THAN IN `tests/e2e/` FOR A MECHANICAL REASON, NOT A PREFERENCE.** Playwright's
// `webServer` is ONE server for the whole run, and `playwright.config.ts` pins
// `VITE_REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION=true` so that TEA-01's seven `signup-confirm-notice` assertions
// keep running against the setting they were written for. A browser test of the OTHER setting would
// need a second config and a second build. `.ai/standards/testing-standards.md` puts seam behaviour
// at the unit level anyway, and what changed IS seam behaviour.
//
// **IT DRIVES THE MOCK IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTLY**, the way `tests/pending-entries.test.ts` and
// `tests/seam-parity.test.ts` do, rather than through `@/lib/data` — which resolves by environment
// and would make this file's subject depend on the machine.
//
// **EVERY TEST RE-IMPORTS THE MODULE, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING.** The mock is module state:
// `signedUp`, `members` and the current session all live for the life of the module. Without
// `resetModules` an account created by one test would still be sign-in-able in the next, and the
// second test would pass for the wrong reason.
