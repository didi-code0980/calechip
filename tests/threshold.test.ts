// ADM-01 — the refusals below the interface. 01-plan.md section 7.
//
// AC-5, AC-9 and AC-14 are refusals the acceptance suite CANNOT reach: it drives the browser and
// cannot call a seam function with a chosen caller. This file does, through `__setCurrentMember` —
// the test-only hook mock.ts exports beside `seam`, and which tests/seam-parity.test.ts already
// uses for CAL-04's shapes. It moves the member and not the session, so it reaches a state the
// application itself cannot; that is exactly what is wanted here, because the subject is the seam's
// answer and not a journey.
//
// IT IS NOT `tests/permission-model.test.ts`. That name is cited by a comment in TEA-01's migration
// (20260831150024_tea01_membership.sql:150) and the file has never existed — 01-plan.md Open
// question 5. Creating it here would mean adopting a scope nobody wrote.
//
// THE MOCK IS THE SUBJECT AND THE POLICY IS WHAT IT REPRODUCES. `team_update_admin` and
// `grant update (overload_threshold) on public.team` are in
// supabase/migrations/20260905000000_adm01_team_threshold.sql and are exercised by no test until a
// project is provisioned (RULE-09 keeps applying it human). What is asserted here is that the mock
// refuses where the policy refuses, which is what keeps the acceptance suite from passing against
// nothing.
